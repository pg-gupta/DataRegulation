    ,"link":"http://fortune.com/2018/12/04/quora-users-data-attack/"
    ,"abstract":"Question-and-answer site Quora is the latest company to suffer a major data breach. It discovered Friday that a 'malicious' third-party had obtained access to 100 million accounts' usernames, email addresses, password hashes and — potentially — data linked from other social networks. The breach also included public contributions, such as users' questions, answers, and upvotes, as well as private contributions, such as downvotes and private messages."

    ,"abstract":"The lack of privacy awareness in smartphone ecosystems prevents users from being able to compare apps in terms of privacy and from making informed privacy decisions. In this paper we analysed smartphone users' privacy perceptions and concerns based on a novel privacy enhancing tool called Android Apps Behaviour Analyser (A3). The A3 tool enables user to behaviourally analyse the privacy aspects of their installed apps and notifies about potential privacy invasive activities. To examine the capabilities of A3 we designed a user study. We captured and contrasted privacy concern and perception of 52 participants, before and after using our tool. The results showed that A3 enables users to easily detect their smartphone app's privacy violation activities. Further, we found that there is a significant difference between users' privacy concern and expectation before and after using A3 and the majority of them were surprised to learn how often their installed apps access personal resources. Overall, we observed that the A3 tool was capable to influence the participants' attitude towards protecting their privacy."

    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117300896"
    ,"abstract":"Personal data lie at the forefront of different business models and constitute the main source of revenue of several online companies. In many cases, consumers may have incomplete information or may be inattentive about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy policies, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers' privacy actions and attitudes. Results of an online survey experiment indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing sensitive and identifiable information, even when positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy are made salient, compared to when privacy is not mentioned. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information. Rather, people are inattentive and their dormant privacy concerns may manifest only when consumers are asked to think about privacy."

At the same time, users also benefit from this ecosystem by being granted free access to services but it is unclear whether this appropriately compensates them for the release of their personal data. As the amount of data collected by online services is exploding, users and organizations increasingly ask for more fair, transparent, and personalized compensations. This naturally raises the question how much is personal data worth?"

    ,"abstract":"Advertisements on social networking sites are typically unrequested messages placed in between the user-generated content. What makes users accept these ads (or not)? A factorial survey was conducted to uncover the impact of different factors related to the use of personal data (e.g., sensitivity of personal data) and advertising place (e.g., ad location) of Facebook ads on user acceptance (i.e., fairness and appropriateness) of the advertisement. Placement of the advertisement was the only factor to significantly affect user acceptance. Moreover, the effect of ad placement largely depended on the degree of involvement with the advertised product. Among low-involved subjects, sidebar ad placement was better accepted. Moreover, the influence of ad placement on user acceptance was fully mediated by perceived intrusiveness of the ad. This indirect effect was not significant in the high-involved subgroup, where message stream placement was better accepted. Implications for targeting advertising on Facebook are discussed."

    ,"abstract":"Data is the new oil, and we are confronted almost daily with stories of folks trying to drill the next high-producing well. Retailers trade loyalty card perks for customer data. Social media trade connectivity for personal data-- tons of it. And schools provide a rich opportunity to trade educational programs and assistance for a rich deposit of data in students (and teachers) who may not even be aware that Big Data is gathering data points by the bushel from their simplest activities. Industry leading Summit Learning, a charter school group that has placed their software and materials in over 300 public schools, has admitted that they share the data they gather with 18 'partners.' The practice is not new; generations of test takers filled out the personal information pages with the PSAT; in 2013, the College Board and ACT were sued over the practice of selling student information. The process has just been accelerated by technology. Whatever you're doing, if you're doing it on a computer, you're leaving a data trail."

Nine brilliant and bold historians present a dynamic picture of cultures in transition and in the process scrutinize a myriad of subjects—the sacrament of confession, volunteer hotlines, Nazi policies toward the family, the Baby Boom, evolving sexuality, the history of contraception, and ever-changing dress codes. They draw upon many unexpected sources, including divorce hearing transcripts, personal ads, and little-known demographic and consumer data."

    ,"abstract":"The discussion on the regulation on citizens' right to privacy grows parallel to the widespread usage and collection of Big Data. This chapter analyses from a law and economics perspective the discussion on the European Union (EU) citizens' rights to privacy with regards to collection, retention, analysis and transfer of personal data in light of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is drafted in coherence with the EU Digital Market Strategy, which aims to create the correct incentives for digital networks and services to flourish by providing trustworthy infrastructure supported by the right regulations. A significant part of achieving this aim would require the EU citizens to trust in using digital services. The GDPR is designed to increase the citizens' trust to use online and digital services by obliging the service providers to comply with the GDPR. This chapter analyses two key compliance requirements of the GDPR through the economic analysis lens and proposes possible changes to the GDPR in line with the Digital Single Market Strategy of the EU. The scope of this chapter's analysis is limited to how to cure information asymmetries between the citizens and the data collectors in order to increase the citizens' trust in using digital services given the fast-changing and delicate legal issues arising from collecting the personal data of the EU citizens. This chapter concludes by suggesting three improvements to the GDPR; more frequent controls for issuing the EU Data Protection Seal, increased independence of the Data Protection Controller and issuance of publicly available, frequent privacy ratings."

Of the criticisms of stability theory, there are three which have motivated the approach taken in this paper. First, the fundamental question seemingly underlying most stability analyses seems inappropriate. Most papers seem to explore the question of developing an adjustment process which will converge to competitive equilibrium. A more appealing approach is the development of adjustment processes which are designed to reflect some realistic process and then consideration of the long-run position of the market if the process is stable. Second, the economic agents in a disequilibrium process should be aware, at least in part, of the disequilibrium in the economy, and adjust their behavior in response to the altered opportunities which are present. Third, in most markets, all the agents are in the market for their own gain and prices get set by a demander or supplier rather than a nonparticipating auctioneer."

    ,"abstract":"This paper aims to propose a tool to help policy makers understand the dynamic relationships between security and privacy on a strategic (macro) level. The methodology is ported from the discipline of Macroeconomics, and applied to the information security and privacy domain. The methodology adopted is the so‐called 'cross methodology' which claims ownership of the well‐known supply/demand market equilibrium exercise. Early evaluation reveals that this is a potentially very effective tool in understanding societal behaviour and position towards information security and privacy and therefore makes this a suitable tool for investigating and exploring scenarios that can assist in policy making.  Up to date, research on the economics of security and privacy has been primarily focusing on a micro level. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology for investigating privacy and security on a macro level. We believe that our approach in undertaking this research is new and looking at the issues and relationships between security and privacy at a macro level, gives a better understanding of the problems at hand and how to resolve them. The proposed tool may increase the efficiency of policy making and planning as it enables the policy makers on a governmental and strategic level to run scenarios in order to investigate the effect of their decisions (for example, an introduction of a stricter law relating to computer misuse) to the delicate balance of security and privacy."

    ,"abstract":"In 2013, the Swiss free newspaper '20 Minuten' launched a series of articles, starting with the headline 'These are the 20 most honest members of parliament'. On the newspaper's online platform, readers could also have a look at 'the most dishonest members of the National Council' and even browse through a list of all members of parliament (MPs) ranked according to the extent to which they kept their campaign promises. The ranking was possible due to the availability of two online information platforms. The first one, 'Smartvote', is an online voting advice application where candidates for parliamentary elections answer a set of policy questions, and voters can answer the same set of questions to evaluate which candidates best match their preferences. The second information platform is accessible via the website of the Swiss national parliament and offers access to all votes in the National Council (the upper house), including the individual voting behavior of all MPs. The combination of these two information tools allowed the newspaper to compare the MPs' stated opinions before the elections (i.e. their pre-election promises) with their actual votes on similar policy issues after the elections."

    ,"abstract":"Privacy is a concept in disarray. Nobody can articulate what it means. As one commentator has observed, privacy suffers from an embarrassment of meanings. Privacy is far too vague a concept to guide adjudication and lawmaking, as abstract incantations of the importance of privacy do not fare well when pitted against more concretely-stated countervailing interests. In 1960, the famous torts scholar William Prosser attempted to make sense of the landscape of privacy law by identifying four different interests. But Prosser focused only on tort law, and the law of information privacy is significantly more vast and complex, extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover, Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This article develops a taxonomy to identify privacy problems in a comprehensive and concrete manner. It endeavors to guide the law toward a more coherent understanding of privacy and to serve as a framework for the future development of the field of privacy law."

In the environment we consider, privacy is the concealment of potentially useful information, but concealment also potentially bestows benefits. In some versions of the environment, the standard Coasian logic applies: given an unambiguous initial assignment of rights and sufficient flexibility in contracting, efficiency in information revelation will result. Coasian bargaining may be impeded, however, by either an inability to make certain commitments or by the presence of significant investments that must be made before the transaction occurs. In such cases, initial assignments of rights (for example, privacy laws) can have consequences for efficiency."

Part I explores the four primary characteristics of big data: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity and their effects of the value of data. Part II analyzes the different types of access barriers that limit entry into the different links of the data value chain. In Part III, we tie together the characteristics of big data markets including potential entry barriers, to analyze their competitive effects. The analysis centers on those instances in which the unique characteristics of big data markets lead to variants in the more traditional competitive analysis. Our analysis suggests that the unique characteristics of big data have an important role to play in analyzing competition and in evaluating social welfare."

    ,"link":"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/access-digital-car-data-and-competition-aftersales-services"
    ,"abstract":"This study looks at car data markets from an economic perspective. We start from several options for the technical characteristics of data access points that have been discussed among stakeholders in the automotive industry. We examine the structure of data markets that are likely to emerge from these characteristics and the implications for the welfare of manufacturers, aftermarket service providers and drivers. Car manufacturers face competition in car markets and aftersales services. However, they can design the car data architecture to ensure their exclusive access to the data. That would give them a monopoly in the market for car data from their brand. They can use this to increase their leverage on aftersales services markets. Our baseline scenario is the Extended Vehicle proposal that manufacturers prefer. This ensures their data access monopoly and enables them to maximizes revenue from data and data-driven aftersales services. It reduces welfare for drivers and aftersales service providers. Two technical variations on the baseline scenario reduce manufacturers' leverage over data server governance and their monopolistic power. That could reduce social welfare losses and transfer more surplus to drivers and service providers, compared to the baseline scenario. Other scenarios examine alternative data access gateways, for instance by keeping the OBD plug open and by applying real time data portability under the GDPR. These scenarios may offer some scope for regulators if they wish to keep alternative data access channels open in order to stimulate competition in aftersales services markets. However, they entail additional hardware and switching costs for consumers, compared to the baseline and are therefore partial and imperfect substitutes. In two final scenarios we examine the market position of B2B data marketplaces and consumer media services platforms. The potential for data aggregation across car brands and other sources creates some possibilities for these platforms to provide a counterweight to monopolistic behaviour by the manufacturers. However, manufacturers' control over the data supply and access to the in-car human interface ensures that they retain substantial leverage over these platforms. Regulators may consider creating the conditions for a more level playing field between OEM services and third-party aftersales service providers. As a next step in this research, the general scenario-based observations in this study would have to be complemented with empirical evidence on the data market power of car manufacturers."

    ,"abstract":"We study the relation between ad networks, consumer privacy and the online advertising market. We consider two publishers that can outsource their ad inventories to an ad network, in a market where consumers and advertisers endogenously multi-home. Differently from publishers, the ad network tracks consumers across websites, limiting wasteful repetition of ads. However, its tracking capability depends on consumer privacy-related choices (e.g., accepting third-party cookies). We show that tracking may increase or decrease the provision of ads, depending on its effect on expected advertising returns and on how audience sizes respond to ad quantities. When they decide whether to allow tracking, consumers exert a positive externality on advertisers. If tracking reduces the provision of ads, there is also a positive indirect externality on consumers. Hence, there may be too little tracking in equilibrium, even from consumers' perspective. We evaluate several privacy policies, including direct regulatory interventions and the creation of markets for the right to track consumers. Finally, we characterize the conditions such that outsourcing to the ad network expands the provision of ads compared to the case where publishers compete directly for advertisers."

    ,"link":"http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1259473/FULLTEXT03.pdf"
    ,"abstract":"People's decisions do not happen in a vacuum; there are multiple factors that may affect them. There are external determinants, such as cost/benefit calculation of decision outcomes. There are also internal factors, such as attitudes, personality, emotions, age, and nationality. Frequently, the latter have a final say on the decision at hand, and similar determinants are triggered during the digital interaction when people make decisions about their privacy. The current digital privacy landscape is filled with recurring security breaches and leaks of personal information collected by online service providers. Growing dependency on Internet-connected devices and increasing privacy risks prompted policy makers to protect individuals' right to privacy. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation requires companies to provide adequate information about their data collection and processing practices to users, to increase privacy awareness and enable better decision making. Regardless, currently there is no sufficient, usable technology, which could help people make improved privacy decisions, decreasing over-disclosure and oversharing. Hence, multidisciplinary researchers aim at developing new privacyenhancing solutions. To define such solutions and successfully convey data provision and processing practices, potential risks, or harms resulting from information disclosure, it is crucial to understand cognitive processes underpinning privacy decisions. In this thesis, we examine privacy decisions and define factors that influence them. We investigate the attitude-behaviour relationship and identify privacy concerns affecting perceptions of privacy. Additionally, we examine factors influencing information sharing, such as emotional arousal and personality traits. Our results demonstrate that there is a relationship between privacy concerns and behaviours, and that simplified models of behaviour are insufficient to accurately predict privacy decisions. Our findings show that internal factors, such as nationality and culture, emotional arousal, and individual characteristics, affect privacy decisions. Based on our findings, we conclude that future models of privacy should incorporate such determinants. Further, we postulate that privacy user interfaces must become more flexible and personalised than the current solutions."

    ,"abstract":"We study a political contest where two candidates advertise on a platform to persuade voters to vote in their favor. Voters are a priori biased towards one of the candidates. The extent of voters' bias can be ascertained by a data intermediary who can decide to sell this information to one, both or neither of the candidates. We contrast the intermediary's incentives for selling information with the platform's incentives to maximize candidates' advertising expenditures, and show that the two conflict in a constant-sum game sense. Ourfindings elucidate tensions between social-media platforms, which often generate data that an intermediary may collect, and an intermediary whose choices can lower the platform's profits. We then proceed to characterize conditions under which the intermediary may influence the outcome of the contest."

Easily forgotten amid the cacophony is data-collecting companies' own expectation of privacy in their extremely valuable property. A federal court decision last week provides a timely reminder that businesses possess civil liberties too, which they can use to defend against unreasonable government intrusion.

    "title":"Alan Westin's Privacy Homo Economicus"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434800"
    ,"abstract":"Homo economicus reliably makes an appearance in regulatory debates concerning information privacy. Under the still-dominant U.S. 'notice and choice' approach to consumer information privacy, the rational consumer is expected to negotiate for privacy protection by reading privacy policies and selecting services consistent with her preferences. A longstanding model for predicting these preferences is Professor Alan Westin's well-known segmentation of consumers into 'privacy pragmatists,' 'privacy fundamentalists,' and 'privacy unconcerned.' To be tenable as a protection for consumer interest, 'notice and choice' requires homo economicus to be broadly reliable as a model. Consumers behaving according to the model will know what they want and how to get it in the marketplace, limiting regulatory approaches to information privacy. While notice and choice is undergoing strong theoretical, empirical, and political critique, U.S. Internet privacy law largely reflects these assumptions. This Article contributes to the ongoing debate about notice and choice in two main ways. First, we consider the legacy Westin's privacy segmentation model itself, which as greatly influenced the development of the notice-and-choice regime. Second, we report on original survey research, collected over four years, exploring Americans' knowledge, preferences, and attitudes about a wide variety of data practices in online and mobile markets. Using these methods, we engage in considered textual analysis, empirical testing, and critique of Westin's segmentation model. Our work both calls into question longstanding assumptions used by Westin and lends new insight into consumers' privacy knowledge and preferences. A close textual look at factual and theoretical assumptions embedded in the segmentation model shows foundational flaws. With testing, we find that the segmentation model lacks validity in important dimensions. In analyzing data from nationwide, telephonic surveys of Internet and mobile phone users, we find an apparent knowledge gap among consumers concerning business practices and legal protections for privacy, calling into question Westin's conclusion that a majority of consumers act pragmatically. We further find that those categorized as 'privacy pragmatists' act differently from Westin's model when directly presented with the value exchange — and thus the privacy tradeoff — offered with these services. These findings reframe the privacy pragmatist and call her influential status in U.S. research, industry practice, and policy into serious question. Under the new view, she cannot be seen as 'pragmatic' at all, but rather as a consumer making choices in the marketplace with substantial deficits in her understanding of business practices. This likewise calls into question policy decisions based on the segmentation model and its assumptions. We conclude that updated research and a policy approach that addresses both rationality and knowledge gaps are key."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3184533"
    ,"abstract":"Sellers are increasingly utilizing big data and sophisticated algorithms to price discriminate among customers. Indeed, we are approaching a world, where each consumer will be charged a personalized price for a personalized product or service. Is this type of price discrimination good or bad? The normative assessment, I argue, depends on the target of discrimination. Sellers are interested in the consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for their goods or services: They maximize profits by charging a price that is as close as possible to the consumer's WTP. This WTP is a function of consumer preferences on the one hand and consumer (mis)perceptions on the other hand. When algorithmic price discrimination targets preferences, it harms consumers but increases efficiency. When price discrimination targets misperceptions, specifically demand-inflating misperceptions, it hurts consumers even more and might also reduce efficiency. In such cases, legal intervention may be needed. In particular, when sellers use personalized pricing, regulators should fight fire with fire and seriously explore the potential of personalized law."

    ,"abstract":"Americans' views about privacy and surveillance are relevant to policymaking on these matters. Key legal decisions about the legitimacy of surveillance or tracking programs have hinged on the question of whether Americans think it is reasonable in certain situations to assume that they will be under observation, or if they expect that their activities will not be monitored. A federal appeals court recently ruled that a National Security Agency program that collects Americans' phone records is illegal. In striking down the program, Judge Gerald Lynch wrote: 'Such expansive development of government repositories of formerly private records would be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans. Perhaps such a contraction is required by national security needs in the face of the dangers of contemporary domestic and international terrorism. But we would expect such a momentous decision to be preceded by substantial debate, and expressed in unmistakable language.'"

    "title":"Americans Reject Tailored Advertising And Three Activities That Enable It"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1478214"
    ,"abstract":"This nationally representative telephone (wire-line and cell phone) survey explores Americans' opinions about behavioral targeting by marketers, a controversial issue currently before government policymakers. Behavioral targeting involves two types of activities: following users' actions and then tailoring advertisements for the users based on those actions. While privacy advocates have lambasted behavioral targeting for tracking and labeling people in ways they do not know or understand, marketers have defended the practice by insisting it gives Americans what they want: advertisements and other forms of content that are as relevant to their lives as possible. Contrary to what many marketers claim, most adult Americans (66%) do not want marketers to tailor advertisements to their interests. Moreover, when Americans are informed of three common ways that marketers gather data about people in order to tailor ads, even higher percentages - between 73% and 86% - say they would not want such advertising. Even among young adults, whom advertisers often portray as caring little about information privacy, more than half (55%) of 18-24 years-old do not want tailored advertising. And contrary to consistent assertions of marketers, young adults have as strong an aversion to being followed across websites and offline (for example, in stores) as do older adults. This survey finds that Americans want openness with marketers. If marketers want to continue to use various forms of behavioral targeting in their interactions with Americans, they must work with policymakers to open up the process so that individuals can learn exactly how their information is being collected and used, and then exercise control over their data. We offer specific proposals in this direction. An overarching one is for marketers to implement a regime of information respect toward the public rather than to treat them as objects from which they can take information in order to optimally persuade them."

Prior work has focused on the use of consumer information for price discrimination. In this paper, I consider two different rationales. In the product improvement model, I assume that collecting consumer information allows firms to improve their product. In the supplemental good model, I assume that collecting consumer information allows firms to know which of two additional goods a consumer values. I show that in both models firms tend to offer too much, rather than too little, privacy protection from the point of view of maximizing consumer welfare. In both models, privacy protections soften the competition between firms and lead to higher prices."

    ,"link":"https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/ts/2007/08/e0544-abs.html"
    ,"abstract":"Security defects in software cost millions of dollars to firms in terms of downtime, disruptions, and confidentiality breaches. However, the economic implications of these defects for software vendors are not well understood. Lack of legal liability and the presence of switching costs and network externalities may protect software vendors from incurring significant costs in the event of a vulnerability announcement, unlike such industries as auto and pharmaceuticals, which have been known to suffer significant loss in market value in the event of a defect announcement. Although research in software economics has studied firms' incentives to improve overall quality, there have not been any studies which show that software vendors have an incentive to invest in building more secure software. The objectives of this paper are twofold. 1) We examine how a software vendor's market value changes when a vulnerability is announced. 2) We examine how firm and vulnerability characteristics mediate the change in the market value of a vendor. We collect data from leading national newspapers and industry sources, such as the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), by searching for reports on published software vulnerabilities. We show that vulnerability announcements lead to a negative and significant change in a software vendor's market value. In our sample, on average, a vendor loses around 0.6 percent value in stock price when a vulnerability is reported. We find that a software vendor loses more market share if the market is competitive or if the vendor is small. To provide further insight, we use the information content of the disclosure announcement to classify vulnerabilities into various types. We find that the change in stock price is more negative if the vendor fails to provide a patch at the time of disclosure. Also, more severe flaws have a significantly greater impact. Our analysis provides many interesting implications for software vendors as well as policy makers. In particular, our study provides some evidence of the value of secure software."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2031979"
    ,"abstract":"We investigate whether personal information posted by job candidates on social media sites is sought and used by prospective employers. We create profiles for job candidates on popular social networks, manipulating information protected under U.S. laws, and submit job applications on their behalf to over 4,000 employers. We find evidence of employers searching online for the candidates. After comparing interview invitations for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate, and a gay versus a straight candidate, we find no difference in callback rates for the gay candidate compared to the straight candidate, but a 13% lower callback rate for the Muslim candidate compared to the Christian candidate. While the difference is not significant at the national level, it exhibits significant and robust heterogeneity in bias at the local level, compatible with existing theories of discrimination. In particular, employers in Republican areas exhibit significant bias both against the Muslim candidate, and in favor of the Christian candidate. This bias is significantly larger than the bias in Democratic areas. The results are robust to using state- and county-level data, to controlling for firm, job, and geographical characteristics, and to several model specifications. The results suggest that 1) the online disclosure of certain personal traits can influence the hiring decisions of U.S. firms and 2) the likelihood of hiring discrimination via online searches varies across employers. The findings also highlight the surprisingly lasting behavioral influence of traditional, offline networks in processes and scenarios where online interactions are becoming increasingly common."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211184"
    ,"abstract":"We test an experimental method for the elicitation of implicit attitudes to privacy risk. We ask individuals to decide whether to incur the risk of revealing private information to other participants. This type of risk that involves a social component corresponds to privacy threats that individuals may face in the field. We derive a measure of individual attitudes to privacy risk with our method. We empirically test the validity of this measure by running a laboratory experiment with 148 participants. Our results confirm that the willingness to incur a privacy risk is driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes, self-reported value for private information, and general attitudes to privacy (derived from survey methods in our study). We also observe that attitudes to privacy risk depend on the order in which measures of risk attitude are elicited, but do not depend on whether there is a preexisting threat to privacy, over which participants have no control. We explain how our method can be simplified and extended for use in eliciting attitudes to a wide range of privacy risks and various types of private information."

    ,"abstract":"While privacy is a highly cherished value, few would argue with the notion that absolute privacy is unattainable. Individuals make choices in which they surrender a certain degree of privacy in exchange for outcomes that are perceived to be worth the risk of information disclosure. This research attempts to better understand the delicate balance between privacy risk beliefs and confidence and enticement beliefs that influence the intention to provide personal information necessary to conduct transactions on the Internet. A theoretical model that incorporated contrary factors representing elements of a privacy calculus was tested using data gathered from 369 respondents. Structural equations modeling (SEM) using LISREL validated the instrument and the proposed model. The results suggest that although Internet privacy concerns inhibit e-commerce transactions, the cumulative influence of Internet trust and personal Internet interest are important factors that can outweigh privacy risk perceptions in the decision to disclose personal information when an individual uses the Internet. These findings provide empirical support for an extended privacy calculus model."

    ,"abstract":"We develop a theory that explains how and when privacy can increase welfare. Without privacy, some individuals misrepresent their preferences, because they will otherwise be statistically discriminated against. This 'chilling effect' hurts them individually, and impairs information aggregation. The information gain from infringing privacy (e.g. by electronic surveillance) can be much smaller than expected ceteris paribus. Overall, privacy is essential for any mechanism of information aggregation, such as markets or a democratic society. It is also redistributive: Like free speech, privacy benefits some and hurts others."

    ,"link":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/724174?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"
    ,"abstract":"The enormous increase in interest in privacy in our society is evident in the public press and in the statute books. In some respects this interest in privacy is paradoxical, for the average citizen has more privacy-more areas of his life in which his behavior is not known by his fellows-than ever before. He lives in a large city, where no one is his keeper; in the small towns of former times privacy was won only by the cleverest people. He works in large organizations, and indeed he (or, more likely, some self-appointed spokesman) laments his alienation. He can shake off most of his past simply by moving-to the South, the West-and no earlier generation except the immigrant waves before World War I was as mobile. If then the privacy issue is a real issue, and not one of those contrived issues that march across the headlines for a time, it probably exists because of the vast growth of government. Governments (at all levels) are now collecting information of a quantity and in a personal detail unknown in history. Consider: it would have been quite impossible for a public official in 1860 to learn anything of the income of a citizen chosen at random without leaving Washington, D.C. Today the files of Social Security, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the microfilms of banking transactions, and other sources are potentially available to answer the question, to say nothing of the fact that perhaps one family in three or four receives payments directly or indirectly from the federal government. In addition the government has become the major instrument by which the information-collecting and information-using practices of private citizens are controlled. Technology has enormously changed the mechanics of gathering and disseminating information, but it is politics and economics that direct the uses of the machinery. Three topics in this large subject are explored here: the nature of privacy in economic behavior; the economic effects of contemporary privacy policies; and the reasons for the appearance of privacy legislation.

    ,"abstract":"Japan has experienced major earthquake disasters in the past. The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011 caused enormous damage. Subsequently, in April 2016, a major tremor centered in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu also occurred. In the event of such a disaster, it is important to ensure that medical services are available and that a lifeline is secured. The use of information and communication technology, or ICT, is essential in implementing such efforts in an efficient manner. For example, ICT is very helpful in searching for evacuation routes, locating evacuation sites, tracking supply shortages, and understanding the situation at medical facilities. The use of ICT for such purposes requires personal information. Users can find their evacuation routes precisely because their locations are confirmed with GPS. People will also be able to locate medical facilities to receive special treatment if they register beforehand their pre-existing conditions. Thus, personal information utilization services are extremely effective in times of disaster. On the other hand, the use of personal information could raise concerns about privacy violations. While the use of personal information may allow for valuable services, privacy could be violated if data are leaked or handled in an inappropriate manner."

The analysis results revealed differences in consumer sentiment and emotion during the following instances, despite their commonality in dealing with a personal information leak: a data leak while using online search services, while using a typical video streaming service such as YouTube, and while using a pornographic video service. Specifically, the user had relatively greater anger toward the business for data leaks encountered while using a typical video streaming service, and relatively greater self-shame for data leaks encountered while using pornographic video services."

    "title":"Anonymity, Autonomy, And The Collection Of Personal Data: Measuring The Privacy Impact Of Google's 2012 Privacy Policy Change"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2909148"
    ,"abstract":"One of the most vexing problems in privacy policy is identifying consumer harm from unwanted observation; because it is highly subjective and is likely to vary greatly throughout the population, it doesn't lend itself to easy measurement. Yet, these types of situations increasingly are the focal point of privacy policy discussions. The primary approach to attempt to quantify subjective harms has been to measure consumers' willingness to exchange personal data for money in an experimental setting. This study takes a different tack, using field data to measure actual consumer response to a real-world reduction in the anonymity of online search. In March 2012, Google began to combine user information across platforms. To the extent that Google's policy change reduced the anonymity associated with Google search, it may have reduced incentives to search sensitive or topics. Using a difference-in-difference estimator with top non-sensitive search terms as the control group, the results suggest that there was a small and short-term reduction in the Google Trends scores for sensitive search. There is no measured difference in reaction between high- and low-privacy demand states. Overall, the results indicate that any consumer welfare loss from Google's policy change was small, and likely swamped by the demand-increasing impact of customization made possible from the cross-platform data sharing. That there is no measurable long-term substitution out of sensitive search may reflect the privacy advantages of searching for sensitive information on Google versus seeking the same information in an interpersonal setting. These findings suggest that privacy policy changes that are publicized should be treated like ordinary price changes — causing marginal consumers to exit and reducing consumer surplus for those who remain — not opportunities for regulatory intervention."

    "title":"Antitrust And Regulating Big Data"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2834611"
    ,"abstract":"The collection of user data online has seen enormous growth in recent years. Consumers have benefited from this growth through an increase in free or heavily subsidized services, better quality offerings, and rapid innovation. At the same time, the debate about Big Data, and what it really means for consumers and competition, has grown louder. Many have focused on whether Big Data even presents an antitrust issue, and whether and how harms resulting from Big Data should be analyzed and remedied under the antitrust laws. The academic literature, however, has somewhat lagged behind the policy debate, and a closer inspection of existing scholarly works reveals a dearth of thorough study of the issue. Commentators generally are split into two camps: one in favor of more proactive antitrust enforcement in the Big Data realm, and one opposing such intervention, considering antitrust inappropriate for regulation of Big Data. The academic case for the former has not, as yet, been fully developed, and is relatively light at present. Meanwhile, policy-focused work by academics and practitioners in this arena suggests that antitrust intervention in Big Data would be premature and misguided, especially considering the myriad pro-competitive benefits offered by Big Data. This article reviews the scholarly work on the implications of Big Data on competition, and considers the potential role of antitrust in the regulation of Big Data. Part I provides an overview of the scarce, academic literature specifically addressing the role of antitrust in Big Data issues. Parts II and III delve into the policy issues surrounding Big Data and whether it poses a risk to competition that warrants antitrust intervention. Part II details the ways in which Big Data may prove pro-competitive while Part III reviews and critiques the suggested potential harms to competition from Big Data. Part IV discusses the suitability of antitrust as the institutional choice for Big Data issues, and Part V concludes that, at present, antitrust is ill suited as the institutional choice. Further, the scholarly case for such harm has not yet been adequately established. Overall, this Article finds much noise as to potential 'problems' around whether current antitrust tools and policy are adequate to deal with a Big Data 'challenge.' In reality, there is no challenge at all, as the arguments for antitrust intervention when Big Data has come up as an issue have never carried the day for any merger or decided conduct case in any Department of Justice Antitrust Division ('DOJ'), Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') or Directorate-General for Competition ('DG Competition') to date."

    ,"abstract":"Although much research exists that examines cognitive events leading up to information disclosure, such as risk-benefit analysis and state-based and trait-based attributes, minimal research exists that examines user responses after a direct or indirect breach of privacy. The present study examines 1,004 consumer responses to two different high-profile privacy breaches using sentiment analysis. Our findings indicate that individuals who experience an actual or surrogate privacy breach exhibit similar emotional responses, and that the pattern of responses resembles well-known reactions to other losses. Specifically, we present evidence that users contemplating evidence of a privacy invasion experience and communicate very similar responses as individuals who have lost loved ones, gone through a divorce or who face impending death because of a terminal illness. These responses parallel behavior associated with the Kübler-Ross's five stages of grief."

    "title":"Are Children Well-Supported by Their Parents Concerning Online Privacy Risks, And Who Supports The Parents?"
    ,"link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10944"
    ,"abstract":"Tablet computers are becoming ubiquitously available at home or school for young children to complement education or entertainment. However, parents of children aged 6-11 often believe that children are too young to face or comprehend online privacy issues, and often take a protective approach to restrict or monitor what children can access online, instead of discussing privacy issues with children. Parents work hard to protect their children's online safety. However, little is known how much parents are aware of the risks associated with the implicit personal data collection by the first- or third-party companies behind the mobile `apps' used by their children, and hence how well parents can safeguard their children from this kind of risks. Parents have always been playing a pivotal role in mitigating children's interactions with digital technologies --- from TV to game consoles, to personal computers --- but the rapidly changing technologies are posing challenges for parents to keep up with. There is a pressing need to understand how much parents are aware of privacy risks concerning the use of tablets and how they are managing them for their primary school-aged young children. At the same time, we must also reach out to the children themselves, who are on the frontline of these technologies, to learn how capable they are to recognise risks and how well they are supported by their parents to cope with these risks. Therefore, in the summer of 2017, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 12 families in Oxfordshire and an online survey with 250 parents. This report summarises our key findings of these two studies."

    ,"abstract":"Although we are reading about data breaches more frequently in the news, it may be that data breaches are not actually becoming more common. What has changed are the laws across the US and world that now require companies to report data breaches. Before such laws were in place, companies were under no obligation to notify individuals, the public, or the government when they experienced a data breach. So what has changed is that announcing data breaches has become more common. But your question remains - in light of the known risks of data breaches, why do so many entities continue to experience high profile and very serious cybersecurity compromises?"

    ,"abstract":"Here is the thing: every project that involves data collection holds potential concerns over data privacy. We all know that cyber threats are increasing—and becoming increasingly sophisticated. We can assume that these dangers will only increase as the amount of data gathered via the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow. Until now, research shows many consumers have been willing to give up personal data so long as it benefits us in some way. (Exclusive shopping deals, anyone?) The issue becomes one of education and transparency. Will we, as smart city residents, know what data is being collected, how it's being monitored, how it's being used, to whom it's being sold, and what will be done with it in the future? Will we have the option to 'opt out' of some elements of data collection if they aren't being de-identified? All of these questions will need to be answered clearly to assuage privacy concerns for smart cities."

    "title":"Are Privacy Policies Informational Or Ideological?"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3023417"
    ,"abstract":"Consumer privacy is predominantly regulated through disclosure. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) strongly urges American businesses to notify consumers about their privacy practices, and the agency is considering requiring 'just-in-time' disclosure that would make these notices more salient and aggressive. American law contains many mandated disclosure rules, and they fall along a spectrum. Some disclosures are indisputably good policy because they alert consumers about material risks that all would agree are bad, such as product warnings about latent dangers of physical harm. These long-accepted 'informational' disclosures are compatible with the compelled speech doctrine of the First Amendment. Other mandated disclosures are arguably poor policy because they mislead consumers and cause foreseeable overreactions. For example, mandated disclosures about the presence of mercury in vaccines, about the foreign origins of products, or about raw correlations between depression and abortion technically consist of factual statements. Nevertheless, they should be treated as 'ideological' disclosures running afoul of the compelled speech doctrine. Much less is known about mandated disclosures that fall in the middle of the range, between clearly informational and clearly ideological disclosures. Mandatory privacy disclosures seem to fall in this middle range. These disclosures do not have the virtue of alerting consumers to risks because they concern attributes that consumers do not consistently see as positive or negative. Some disclosures are useful for preference matching where consumers value a product more after learning about an attribute, while others value it less. Some disclosures are useless, meaning that consumers informed about the attribute do not change their valuation at all. These middle range disclosures may be wasteful, but they are not fraudulent or distortive. How should the First Amendment treat the laws that mandate disclosure about these attributes? This essay presents a theory and practical instrument for distinguishing between informational and ideological mandated disclosures, and shows that at least some of the privacy policies required by law are constitutionally suspect."

    "title":"Behavioral Advertising: The Offer You Cannot Refuse"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2137601"
    ,"abstract":"At UC Berkeley, we are informing political debates surrounding online privacy through empirical study of website behaviors. In 2009 and 2011, we surveyed top websites to determine how they were tracking consumers. We found that advertisers were using persistent tracking technologies that were relatively unknown to consumers. Two years later, we found that the number of tracking cookies expanded dramatically and that advertisers had developed new, previously unobserved tracking mechanisms that users cannot avoid even with the strongest privacy settings. These empirical observations are valuable for the political debate surrounding online privacy because they inform the framing and assumptions surrounding the merits of privacy law. Our work demonstrates that advertisers use new, relatively unknown technologies to track people, specifically because consumers have not heard of these techniques. Furthermore, these technologies obviate choice mechanisms that consumers exercise. We argue that the combination of disguised tracking technologies, choice-invalidating techniques, and models to trick the consumers into revealing data suggests that advertisers do not see individuals as autonomous beings. Once conceived of as objects, preferences no longer matter and can be routed around with tricks and technology. In the political debate, 'paternalism' is a frequently invoked objection to privacy rules. Our work inverts the assumption that privacy interventions are paternalistic while market approaches promote freedom. We empirically demonstrate that advertisers are making it impossible to avoid online tracking. Advertisers are so invested in the idea of a personalized web that they do not think consumers are competent to decide to reject it. We argue that policymakers should fully appreciate the idea that consumer privacy interventions can enable choice, while the alternative, pure marketplace approaches can deny consumers opportunities to exercise autonomy."

    ,"abstract":"This paper presents empirical data on American adult Internet users' knowledge about and perceptions of Internet advertising techniques. We present the results of in-depth interviews and an online survey focusing on participants' views of online advertising and their ability to make decisions about privacy tradeoffs. We find users hold misconceptions about the purpose of cookies and the effects of clearing them, which limits cookie management as a self-help mechanism enabling user choice. Only 11% of respondents understood the text description of NAI opt-out cookies, which are a self-help mechanism that enables user choice. 86% believe ads are tailored to websites they have visited in the past, but only 39% believe there are currently ads based on email content, and only 9% think it is OK to see ads based on email content as long as their email service is free. About 20% of participants want the benefits of targeted advertising, but 64% find the idea invasive, and we see signs of a possible chilling effect with 40% self-reporting they would change their online behavior if advertisers were collecting data. We find a gap between people's willingness to pay to protect their privacy and their willingness to accept discounts in exchange for private information. 69% believe privacy is a right and 61% think it is 'extortion' to pay to keep their data private. Only 11% say they would pay to avoid ads. With the exception of contextual advertisements, we find most participants would prefer random ads to tailored ads, but approximately 20% of participants would rather tailored ads. We find participants are comfortable with the idea that advertising supports free online content, but they do not believe their data are part of that exchange. We conclude with observations for public policy, technologists, and education."

    ,"abstract":"In the course of writing and publishing a monthly newsletter about the right to privacy, I have practiced the advice attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt: 'Go out and see for yourself. Make others see what you've seen.' This book is the product of that endeavor. Since 1974 when I began publishing Privacy Journal newsletter, writing books on the subject, and advocating increased recognition of the right to privacy, I have been accumulating lots of files. In one of those folders marked 'History of Privacy,' I kept items like the one about FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover complaining about clandestine sex in the motor courts of the 1930s. Then I found an intriguing observation from the French humorist Paul Blouet late in the Nineteenth Century about the typical American, 'Meeting you in a railway carriage, he will ask you point blank where you are going, what you are doing, and where you are from. By degrees, he grows bolder.' At that point I formed the idea for a book on the history of privacy. But this story is about more than privacy. (Secretly, I have long felt that Americans are a little bit nervous about the subject - and probably reluctant to read a whole book about privacy.) Nearly all other books about privacy assume that this is a positive value shared by all Americans. I'm not sure that it is. Our feelings about personal privacy - our privacy and everyone else's - are ambivalent. To understand why, you have to look to all aspects of our culture. When you do, you discover that we value our curiosity more than our privacy.'"

    ,"abstract":"Just a couple months ago, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty inveighed against big tech companies abusing people's data at a privacy conference in Brussels. She cited a 'trust crisis,' ascribing its origins to 'the irresponsible handling of personal data by a few dominant consumer-facing platforms.' Rometty did not have to identify the subjects of her criticism by name, Facebook no doubt among them, for people to understand her point."

    ,"abstract":"Big data refers to the ability to gather large volumes of data, often from multiple sources, and with it produce new kinds of observations, measurements and predictions. Commercial applications of big data deserve ongoing scrutiny given the speed at which both the technology and business practices are evolving. One of the many questions raised by big data is whether companies will use the information they harvest to more effectively charge different prices to different customers, a practice that economists call price discrimination. Economics suggests that many forms of differential pricing, such as senior citizen discounts at the box office or tiered pricing for air travel, can be good for both businesses and consumers. However, the combination of differential pricing and big data raises concerns that some consumers can be made worse off, and have very little knowledge why. This report finds that many companies already use big data for targeted marketing, and some are experimenting with personalized pricing, though examples of personalized pricing remain fairly limited. While substantive concerns about differential pricing in the age of big data remain, many of them can be addressed by enforcing existing antidiscrimination, privacy, and consumer protection laws. In addition, providing consumers with increased transparency into how companies use and trade their data would promote more competition and better informed consumer choice."

    ,"abstract":"Big data, enhanced behavioral profiling, and information analytics will tend to have a leveling-down effect on the negotiating power of workers against management, and against other more privileged workers. The article looks specifically at the bellwether case of baseball in the wake of the Moneyball revolution–the increasingly sophisticated quantification of baseball players' contributions. The analysis shows that although major league teams are increasingly relying on the lower paid to produce baseball wins, the share of salary the lower paid has commanded relative to their contribution has declined in the era of Moneyball. Information has allowed baseball teams to wring more out of lower-paid baseball players more efficiently, by identifying to management highly productive substitutes. The article compares the situation in baseball to other labor markets, and concludes that transparency of data analytics is an insufficient solution to the 'leveling down' effect of big data on wages."

    ,"abstract":"In a context where more and more personal data is gathered by companies thanks to the rise of social networks, the internet of things, e-commerce and many other online services, it is interesting to explore how this data can be used profitably by different businesses. One potential application is to use online data to estimate the willingness to pay of consumers in order to implement personalised pricing. The goal of this thesis is threefold. First of all, I investigate to what extend price discrimination is already being used online. Secondly, I analyse the future economic potential of personalised pricing in the light of the recent progress in data collection and analytics. Thirdly, I examine the economic implications for different stakeholders resulting from a hypothetical large-scale use of personalised pricing by online shops. In this context, I also review current regulation and suggest potential improvements."

This was a powerful demonstration of the so-called law of one price, the economic principle that markets produce a single price for a given commodity or good."

    ,"abstract":"Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency, including electronic payments. Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power. Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure—or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment—though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems. This article presents the platform's design principles and properties for a nontechnical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy."

    ,"abstract":"Experiencing ownership is central to what it means to be human and it is central to the functioning of societies. One notion that is inherently tied to ownership is the notion of boundaries around the owned target and between owners and non-owners. These boundaries enable humans to claim, to exert control over and to take responsibility for that which is owned. All of which are necessary to motivate and enable sustainable behaviors. In this contribution, I highlight ways in which current societal and technological trends, in particular the fast paced movement towards encompassing digitalization of life, erode the boundaries necessary for the experience of ownership. I further discuss how this erosion may not only hamper feelings of ownership but even go so far as to shift the perception of humans from owners to those being owned; thus, undermining humans perceived capability as responsible agents. In response, I suggest a necessary transformation in terms of digital boundaries and empowerment, potentially taking the shape of digital blueprints and agents."

    ,"abstract":"The boundaries between the fields of competition, consumer and data protection law have become blurred in the digital economy. This is particularly the case for the rules governing practices of market players relating to the collection and use of personal data of individuals. In addition to possible competition issues, concerns are increasingly raised about the level of data and consumer protection offered by current market players. Ongoing policy and academic debates have begun to consider the question of how these three legal fields interact. The chapter aims to shed light on this issue by comparing the relevant legal concepts as well as the available remedies in each of these areas of law and by outlining how synergies can be achieved with the objective of providing consumers in digital markets with a more integrated form of protection."

These scientists have demonstrated they can often 'reidentify' or 'deanonymize' individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we will realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed.

    ,"link":"https://scholar.harvard.edu/jin/publications/ubi_jmp"
    ,"abstract":"This paper studies the design and impact of auto-insurance monitoring programs, in which insurers offer financial incentives to consumers who choose to have their driving behavior monitored. We gather proprietary datasets from a major U.S. auto insurer. These include over one million insurance policies as well as data collected in a monitoring program. The data is then matched with over 50 million insurance quotes from competitors. Using reduced-form methods and a novel structural model, we find that the monitoring program improves both consumer welfare and firm profit. To support this finding, we quantify four countervailing economic forces. (i) Monitoring reduces accident claims by 29%. (ii) It reveals private information on driver risk, improving the firm's risk rating. (iii) Consumers have large and heterogeneous cost in participating monitoring. This prevents unraveling but also limits the program's impact. (iv) Market competition enhances consumers' outside options and reduces the monitoring program's profitability. Taken together, introducing monitoring improves profit by 27% and consumer welfare by 4%. Competitors see lower profit, but market surplus increases by 2%. Finally, we explore the equilibrium implications of two types of regulations: required disclosure of the firm's proprietary data, and mandatory monitoring for drivers."

    ,"abstract":"To broadly examine the potential health and financial benefits of health information technology (HIT), this paper compares health care with the use of IT in other industries. It estimates potential savings and costs of widespread adoption of electronic medical record (EMR) systems, models important health and safety benefits, and concludes that effective EMR implementation and networking could eventually save more than $81 billion annually—by improving health care efficiency and safety—and that HIT-enabled prevention and management of chronic disease could eventually double those savings while increasing health and other social benefits. However, this is unlikely to be realized without related changes to the health care system."

    ,"abstract":"Electronic medical records (EMRs) facilitate fast and accurate access to patient records, which could improve diagnosis and patient monitoring. Using a 12-year county-level panel, we find that a 10 percent increase in births that occur in hospitals with EMRs reduces neonatal mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is driven by a reduction of deaths from conditions requiring careful monitoring. We also find a strong decrease in mortality when we instrument for EMR adoption using variation in state medical privacy laws. Rough cost-effectiveness calculations suggest that EMRs are associated with a cost of $531,000 per baby's life saved."

In this speech I explored some aspects of the scope for market provision of privacy to the extent that it is a final good, valued for its own sake by consumers whose preferences are respected and who broadly know how to evaluate it. I stressed that if standard commitment and information conditions for efficient contracting hold, there seems no obvious reason why privacy should not be efficiently chosen by profit-seeking firms— but that there are particular reasons why those standard conditions may be especially challenging in the privacy context.

We show that in the global economy of app developers, the geographical location of the developer influences whether they collect sensitive data, such as precise location, about their child users. Developers based in the US or in the OECD are less likely to collect sensitive data, while developers in countries that have no privacy law are most likely to collect sensitive data. We also distinguish the effects of an official Google program which encourages developers to comply with US child privacy regulation. We find that 10% of apps that are targeted at children under 5 that certify themselves via the program collect sensitive data from their child users. By contrast, 47% of apps which are targeted at children under 5 through keywords such as ‘toddler' or ‘preschool' which do not self-certify collect sensitive data about their users."

Adware allows advertisers to send targeted information to consumers which improves their purchasing decisions, but also entails a loss of privacy. I show that adware is more profitable when the perceived quality of the software is relatively low, when tracking technology improves, when consumers benefit more from information on consumer products and are less likely to receive it from external sources. I also show that improvements in the technology of display ads will lead to less violation of privacy and will benefit consumers, that depending on the software's quality, there are either too many or too few display ads in equilibrium, and that from a social perspective, adware dominates commercial software."

    ,"abstract":"This paper studies decisions by firms of whether to attempt 'behavior-based' price discrimination in markets with switching costs by using a two-period duopoly model. When both firms commit themselves to a pricing policy and consumers are 'sophisticated' and have rational expectations, there is a dominant strategy equilibrium with both firms engaging in uniform pricing. Both firms are better off in the uniform pricing equilibrium, compared with the discriminatory equilibrium."

    ,"abstract":"This paper studies competition in data-driven markets, that is, markets where the cost of quality production is decreasing in the amount of machine-generated data about user preferences or characteristics, which is an inseparable byproduct of using services offered in such markets. This gives rise to data-driven indirect network effects. We construct a dynamic model of R&D competition, where duopolists repeatedly determine their innovation investments, and show that such markets tip under very mild conditions, moving towards monopoly. In a tipped market, innovation incentives both for the dominant firm and for competitors are small. We also show under which conditions a dominant firm in one market can leverage its position to a connected market, thereby initiating a domino effect. We show that market tipping can be avoided if competitors share their user information."

    ,"abstract":"Many retailers and social media sites trade their customer data to brokers who use these data to identify relevant market demographics and target segments. This information is valuable to a wide array of industries from trending fashion to health care. For consumers who value privacy however, trading data can be a 'bad' and firms that do so may suffer a reputation loss. Our paper investigates whether a self-regulated market operating with transparent privacy policies will lead to an efficient market outcome. Competition in the product market is characterized by both horizontal and vertical differentiation, the latter being affected by the firms' decisions whether or not to trade their consumer data. We identify market conditions under which, from the perspective of consumers, there is excessive selling of consumer data, but we also identify cases in which both consumers and firms would be better off with stricter privacy legislation or restrictions. We show that there are yet other cases where firms' concern about loss of reputation leads to too little trading of data and both consumers and firms would be better off if there were more data trading."

    ,"abstract":"In the last couple of decades, competition policy has been receiving increasing attention and has obtained a central role in microeconomic policy in Europe. Ensuring that markets work as competitively as possible is viewed as key for economic growth and welfare. While much progress has been made in the research that studies and shapes competition policy, the nature of competition in markets is also evolving and new issues are emerging. An important novel feature is related to the increase in the size of the digital sectors of the economy and especially to the way that digital technologies and e-commerce practices revolutionize essentially all other sectors of the economy. These developments represent some new challenges for research. One key issue is that with digital markets and technologies we are more likely to have intense competition ‘for the market', rather than competition ‘in the market'. It follows that we need models that are more dynamic and incorporate to a larger extent network effects, other increasing returns to scale and uncertainty. At the same time, it is important that one does not ignore the lessons of the earlier and current literature, especially in core areas like pricing and vertical relations. On the empirical research side, the availability of relevant data can be expected to increase exponentially, due to the fact that electronic transactions can be recorded almost automatically. The need and opportunity for new empirical studies, given the nature of available data, thus emerges. New technologies also tend to minimize the distances between buyers and sellers in markets and facilitate information flows; ‘single market' issues therefore come to the forefront and their analysis can be controversial. This challenge becomes a clear priority since the Digital SingleMarket is a stated objective of the European Commission."

    ,"abstract":"Limited consumer attention limits product market competition: prices are stochastically lower the more attention is paid. Ads compete to be the lowest price in a sector but compete for attention with ads from other sectors: equilibrium ad shares follow a CES form. When a sector gets more profitable, its advertising expands: others lose ad market share. The ìinformation humpî shows highest ad levels for intermediate attention levels. The Information Age takes off when the number of viable sectors grows, but total ad volume reaches an upper limit. Overall, advertising is excessive, though the allocation across sectors is optimal.The Information Age has a surfeit of information received relative to what is processed. We model multiple sectors competing for consumer attention, with competition in price within each sector. Sector advertising levels follow a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form, and within‐sector prices are dispersed with a truncated Pareto distribution. The 'information hump' shows highest ad levels for intermediate attention levels. Overall, advertising is excessive, although the allocation across sectors is optimal.

    ,"abstract":"The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform's elements point into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been over-looked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should fol-low the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established."

    ,"abstract":"With the advent of panel data on household purchase behavior, and the development of statistical procedures to utilize this data, firms can now target coupons to selected households with considerable accuracy and cost effectiveness. In this article, we develop an analytical framework to examine the effect of such targeting on firm profits, prices, and coupon face values. We also derive comparative statics on firms' optimal mix of offensive and defensive couponing, the number of coupons distributed, redemption rates, face values, and incremental sales per redemption. Among our findings: when rival firms can target their coupon promotions at brand switchers, the outcome will be a prisoner's dilemma in which the net effect of targeting is simply the cost of distribution plus the discount given to redeemers."

    ,"abstract":"Buyers often search across sellers to learn which product best fits their needs. We study how sellers manage these search incentives through their disclosure strategies (e.g., product trials, reviews, and recommendations) and ask how competition affects information provision. If sellers can observe the beliefs of buyers or can coordinate their strategies, then there is an equilibrium in which sellers provide the 'monopoly level' of information. In contrast, if buyers' beliefs are private, then there is an equilibrium in which sellers provide full information as search costs vanish. Anonymity and coordination thus play important roles in understanding how advice markets work."

    ,"abstract":"One-to-one promotions are possible when consumers are individually addressable and firms know something about each customer's preferences. We explore the competitive effects of one-to-one promotions in a model with two competing firms where the firms differ in size and consumers have heterogeneous brand loyalty. We find that one-to-one promotions always lead to an increase in price competition (average prices in the market decrease). However, we also find that one-to-one promotions affect market shares. This market-share effect may outweigh the effect of lower prices, benefiting the firm whose market share increases. Our results suggest that of two firms, the firm with the higher-quality product may gain from one-to-one promotions. Our model also has implications for the phenomenon of customer churn, where consumers switch to a less preferred brand due to targeted promotional incentives. We show that churning can arise optimally from firms pursuing a profit-maximizing strategy. Instead of trying to minimize it, the optimal way to manage customer churn is to engage in both offensive and defensive promotions with the relative mix depending on the marginal cost of targeting."

    ,"link":"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/101850"
    ,"abstract":"The breadcrumbs left behind by our technologies have the power to fundamentally transform the health and development of societies. Metadata about our whereabouts, social lives, preferences, and finances can be used for good but can also be abused. In this thesis, I show that the richness of today's datasets have rendered traditional data protections strategies outdated, requiring us to deeply rethink our approach. First, I show that the concept of anonymization, central to legal and technical data protection frameworks, does not scale. I introduce the concept of unicity to study the risks of re-identification of large-scale metadata datasets given p points. I then use unicity to show that four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95% of people in a mobile phone dataset and 90% of people in a credit card dataset. In both cases, I also show that traditional de-identification strategies such as data generalization are not sufficient to approach anonymity in modern high-dimensional datasets. Second, I argue that the second pillar of data protection, risk assessment, is similarly crumbling as data gets richer. I show, for instance, how standard mobile phone data-information on how and when somebody calls or texts-can be used to predict personality traits up to 1.7 times better than random. The risk of inference in big data will render comprehensive risks assessments increasingly difficult and, moving forward, potentially irrelevant as they will require evaluating what can be inferred now, and in the future, from rich data. However, this data has a great potential for good especially in developing countries. While it is highly unlikely that we will ever find a magic bullet or even a one-size- fits-all approach to data protection, there are ways that exist to use metadata in privacy-conscientious ways. I finish this thesis by discussing technical solutions (incl. privacy-through-security ones) which, when combined with legal and regulatory frameworks, provide a reasonable balance between the imperative of using this data and the legitimate concerns of the individual and society."

Thus, absent further considerations, efficiency requires that a person be afforded privacy if, and only if, his subjective valuation of privacy exceeds the social value of the information that would be disclosed through a violation of that person's privacy. Absolute regimes that either always allow privacy, or never allow privacy, cannot achieve this result. This article shows that a conditional privacy regime can lead to efficient separation among people based on their subjective valuations of privacy.

    ,"abstract":"The rapid advance in information technology now makes it feasible for sellers to condition their price offers on consumers' prior purchase behavior. In this paper we examine when it is profitable to engage in this form of price discrimination when consumers can adopt strategies to protect their privacy. Our baseline model involves rational consumers with constant valuations for the goods being sold and a monopoly merchant who can commit to a pricing policy. Applying results from the prior literature, we show that although it is feasible to price so as to distinguish high-value and low-value consumers, the merchant will never find it optimal to do so. We then consider various generalizations of this model, such as allowing the seller to offer enhanced services to previous customers, making the merchant unable to commit to a pricing policy, and allowing competition in the marketplace. In these cases we show that sellers will, in general, find it profitable to condition prices on purchase history."

    ,"abstract":"Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are well-defined, domain-specific means to preserve information privacy in computerized systems, i.e., by protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII). We believe that increasing privacy awareness and governance will lead to wider adoption of PETs in service infrastructures. To support that, a better understanding of privacy-enhanced services composed out of multiple PETs is necessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no general domain-independent and formal PET model and research about their composition is missing. The work at hand presents a formal, set-based and domain-independent taxonomy model for PETs, along with an algebra for constrained composition of PETs. The measurement of enforced privacy in service infrastructures with deployed PETs is one of many use cases for such a PET algebra and is demonstrated subsequently in a scenario with two exemplary privacy-enhanced services."

    "title":"Consumer Addressability And Customized Pricing"
    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.2.197.153"
    ,"abstract":"The increasing availability of customer information is giving many firms the ability to reach and customize price and other marketing efforts to the tastes of the individual consumer. This ability is labeled as consumer addressability. Consumer addressability through sophisticated databases is particularly important for direct-marketing firms, catalog retailers such as L.L Bean and Land's End, credit card-issuing banks, and firms in the long-distance telephone market. We examine the strategic implications of consumer addressability on competition between database/direct marketing firms. We address questions such as: In a competitive environment, how should firms invest in addressability? Will future improvements in the degree of addressability increase or mitigate the intensity of competition between the firms? Will greater addressability always be beneficial for firms? We model competition between two firms in a market where consumers differ on a horizontal attribute of product differentiation. The market comprises consumers located on a linear attribute space and firms located at the ends of the line. We represent the degree of addressability (or the reach of a firm's database) as the proportion of consumers at each point in the market who are in the firm's database. Consequently, the firm can offer these consumers customized prices. Consumer addressability creates two effects that govern the competition between firms: a 'surplus extraction' effect because a firm might address a consumer who is not reached by its competitor and a 'competitive' effect that is created by the set of consumers who can be addressed by both firms. The key results of the paper pertain to when the addressability decision is endogenous. When the extent of market differentiation (or consumer heterogeneity in preferences for a product/brand attribute), as well as the incremental cost of addressability, are sufficiently large, firms make symmetric investments in equilibrium. Given high costs, firms choose sufficiently low levels of addressability. Low addressability and high levels of market differentiation both help reduce price competition, which facilitates symmetric choice of addressability by the firms in equilibrium. However, when market differentiation and the cost of incremental addressability become small, firms face the prospect of destructive competition. As a result, they strategically differentiate in their choice of addressability to mitigate this competition. Interestingly, even in the extreme case when incremental addressability is costless, not every firm chooses full addressability in equilibrium. This has useful implications for direct marketing. Given that the advances in information technology should improve the ability of firms to address their consumers, it might indeed not be desirable for all direct marketing firms to indefinitely pursue greater addressability as costs of doing so decline. The analysis also shows an interesting effect of market differentiation in addressable markets: Equilibrium profits can decrease with an increase in market differentiation when the marginal cost of addressability is sufficiently high. Finally, we discuss the competitive outcome that would result when firms compete with addressable as well as uniform posted prices."

We present results from a series of large‐scale field experiments done at eBay that were designed to measure the causal effectiveness of paid search ads. Because search clicks and purchase intent are correlated, we show that returns from paid search are a fraction of non‐experimental estimates. As an extreme case, we show that brand keyword ads have no measurable short‐term benefits. For non‐brand keywords, we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that are negative."

    ,"abstract":"In the current age of information and big data, consumer informational privacy has become an important issue in marketing. Besides being worried about the growing collection, storage, and use of personal information, consumers are anxious about a lack of transparency or control over their personal data. Despite these growing concerns, understanding of how firms' privacy practices affect consumers remains limited. We review the relevant literature on consumer privacy from a marketing perspective and summarize current knowledge about how information collection, information storage, information use, transparency, and control influence consumers' behavior. In addition, we discuss to what extent the influence of firms' privacy practices differs between firms, consumers, and environments. On the basis of this knowledge, we formulate several hypotheses aimed at providing direction for future research regarding the role of consumer informational privacy in marketing."

    ,"abstract":"We introduce the concept of marketing avoidance—consumer efforts to conceal themselves and to deflect marketing. The setting is one in which sellers market some item through solicitations to potential consumers, who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving solicitations. Concealment by one consumer induces sellers to shift solicitations to other consumers, whereas deflection does not. Solicitations cause two externalities: direct harm on consumers and the (indirect) cost of consumer concealment and deflection. We find that in markets where the marginal cost of solicitation is sufficiently low, efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less. Furthermore, concealment by low-benefit consumers increases direct privacy harm, and consumer welfare is higher with deflection than concealment. Finally, it is optimal to impose a charge on solicitations."

    ,"abstract":"This paper studies how product customization and consumer privacy affect a monopolist's incentives to engage in perfect price discrimination. We consider a monopolist that faces an ex ante choice to commit to price discrimination or to a uniform price. We introduce a simple model in which a monopolist can use analytics to access consumer data to both price-discriminate and offer customized products. In turn, consumers can protect their privacy to avoid price discrimination at a cost. By committing not to price-discriminate, the firm induces consumers to not protect their data, which allows it to customize the product. It can then extract the extra value through an increased uniform price. This strategy is profitable when the value added through customization is sufficiently high. An intermediate quality of analytics gives the monopolist more incentives to set a uniform price."

    ,"abstract":"At its core, this article is concerned with property rights. Does a firm have the right to collect and sell valuable information about the identity and purchasing habits of its customers, or do consumers have the right to anonymity? Both settings were analyzed in the context of a simple strategic model without commitment. It was shown that firms fare well under a customer disclosure regime when consumers do not anticipate the sale of their information. Indeed, in such a setting the opportunity to sell its customer list can provide a firm with incentives to charge high experimental prices. Such experimentation unambiguously lowers welfare because the loss in consumer surplus outweighs the value of the information obtained by the firms. When demand is very inelastic, however, welfare is actually higher under the disclosure regime when consumers are naive because firms offer lower prices to customers who did not previously purchase.

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3020503"
    ,"abstract":"We study consumer privacy choice in the context of online display advertising, where advertisers track consumers' browsing to improve ad targeting. In 2010, the American ad industry implemented a self-regulation mechanism that overlaid 'AdChoices' icons on ads, which consumers could click to opt out of online behavioral advertising. We examine the real-world uptake of AdChoices using transaction data from an ad exchange. Though consumers express strong privacy concerns in surveys, we find that only 0.23% of American ad impressions arise from users who opted out of online behavioral advertising. We also find that opt-out user ads fetch 59.2% less revenue on the exchange than do comparable ads for users who allow behavioral targeting. These findings are broadly consistent with evidence from the European Union and Canada, where industry subsequently implemented the AdChoices program. We calculate an upper bound for the industry's value of the average opt-out user's browsing information to be $8 per capita annually in the US. We find that opt-out users tend to be more technologically sophisticated, though opt-out rates are higher in American states with lower income. These results inform the privacy policy discussion by illuminating the real-world consequences of an opt-out privacy mechanism."

    ,"abstract":"We consider a model where a monopolist can profile consumers in order to price discriminate among them, and consumers can take costly actions to protect their identities and make the profiling technology less effective. A novel aspect of the model consists in the profiling technology: the signal that the monopolist gets about a consumer's willingness-to-pay can be made more accurate either by having more consumers revealing their identities, or by spending larger amounts of money on third-party complementary data or data analytics capabilities. We show that the optimal investment level from the monopolist is closely related to the flexibility of consumers to conceal their identities as well as to data requirements. In particular, a higher (lower) data requirement is an instance when more (less) consumers are required to achieve the same signal precision. For a given data requirement, we show that a smaller investment is required to achieve the same level of accuracy when it gets more difficult for consumers to conceal their identities, leading to a higher profit for the firm. Consumer surplus and social welfare are instead non-monotone in the ability of consumers to conceal their identities. Surprisingly, the firm's investment is not monotone in the level of data requirement, where investment is the greatest when data requirement is moderate. We also show that the monopolist has a tendency to invest excessively. This inefficiency is particularly acute either when the firm needs many profiled consumers in the dataset to be precise ('big data') and the action for consumers to protect their identities is costly, or when the firm can profile consumers effectively with only a few of them ('small data') and the cost of consumers' identification concealing is moderate."

    "title":"Context, Causality, And Information Flow: Implications For Privacy Engineering, Security, And Data Economics"
    ,"link":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5sg7q32q"
    ,"abstract":"The creators of technical infrastructure are under social and legal pressure to comply with expectations that can be difficult to translate into computational and business logics. This dissertation bridges this gap through three projects that focus on privacy engineering, information security, and data economics, respectively. These projects culminate in a new formal method for evaluating the strategic and tactical value of data: data games. This method relies on a core theoretical contribution building on the work of Shannon, Dretske, Pearl, Koller, and Nissenbaum: a definition of situated information flow as causal flow in the context of other causal relations and strategic choices. The first project studies privacy engineering's use of Contextual Integrity theory (CI), which defines privacy as appropriate information flow according to norms specific to social contexts or spheres. Computer scientists using CI have innovated as they have implemented the theory and blended it with other traditions, such as context-aware computing. This survey examines computer science literature using Contextual Integrity and discovers, among other results, that technical and social platforms that span social contexts challenge CI's current commitment to normative social spheres. Sociotechnical situations can and do defy social expectations with cross-context clashes, and privacy engineering needs its normative theories to acknowledge and address this fact.  This concern inspires the second project, which addresses the problem of building computational systems that comply with data flow and security restrictions such as those required by law. Many privacy and data protection policies stipulate restrictions on the flow of information based on that information's original source. We formalize this concept of privacy as Origin Privacy. This formalization shows how information flow security can be represented using causal modeling. Causal modeling of information security leads to general theorems about the limits of privacy by design as well as a shared language for representing specific privacy concepts such as noninterference, differential privacy, and authorized disclosure. The third project uses the causal modeling of information flow to address gaps in current theory of data economics. Like CI, privacy economics has focused on individual economic contexts and so has been unable to comprehend an information economy that relies on the flow of information across contexts. Data games, an adaptation of Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams for mechanism design, are used to model the well known economic contexts of principal-agent contracts and price differentiation as well as new contexts such as personalized expert services and data reuse. This work reveals that information flows are not goods but rather strategic resources, and that trade in information therefore involves market externalities."

    ,"abstract":"The privacy issues arising in big data applications can be dealt with an economical way. Privacy can be seen as a special type of goods, in a sense that it can be traded by the owner for incentives. In this chapter, we consider a private data collecting scenario where a data collector buys data from multiple data providers and employs anonymization techniques to protect data providers' privacy. Anonymization causes a decline of data utility, therefore, the data provider can only sell his data at a lower price if his privacy is better protected. Achieving a balance between privacy protection and data utility is an important question for the data collector. Considering that different data providers treat privacy differently, and their privacy preferences are unknown to the collector, we propose a contract theoretic approach for data collector to deal with the data providers. By designing an optimal contract, the collector can make rational decisions on how to pay the data providers, and how to protect the providers' privacy. Performance of the proposed contract is evaluated by numerical simulations and experiments on real-world data. The contract analysis shows that when the collector requires a large amount of data, he should ask data providers who care privacy less to provide as much as possible data. We also find that when the collector requires higher utility of data or the data become less profitable, the collector should provide a stronger protection of the providers' privacy."

    ,"abstract":"Practices to create value from personal data in internet-enabled services (IES) remain socially contested. Indeed, the commercial exploitation of personal data violates social expectations and conflicts with individuals' privacy needs. To explore this tension, we draw on media coverage on IES between 1990-2015. In doing so we examine what, why and to what extent particular business practices have struggled to gain legitimacy. Our findings provide evidence for 1) the power of social control mechanisms in enforcing business practices to match with social expectations, and, paradoxically 2) a fundamental change in these very social expectations in the form of a shift in the dominant institutional logics surrounding IES. By elaborating on the underlying processes of collective assessments of legitimacy in the field of IES, we draw attention to the role of a collective privacy calculus, which might be more salient in shaping flows of personal data than previously expected."

    ,"abstract":"After years of speculation, price discrimination in e-commerce driven by the personal information that users leave (involuntarily) online, has started attracting the attention of privacy researchers, regulators, and the press. In our previous work we demonstrated instances of products whose prices varied online depending on the location and the characteristics of prospective online buyers. In an effort to scale up our study we have turned to crowd-sourcing. Using a browser extension we have collected the prices obtained by an initial set of 340 test users as they surf the web for products of their interest. This initial dataset has permitted us to identify a set of online stores where price variation is more pronounced. We have focused on this subset, and performed a systematic crawl of their products and logged the prices obtained from different vantage points and browser configurations. By analyzing this dataset we see that there exist several retailers that return prices for the same product that vary by 10%-30% whereas there also exist isolated cases that may vary up to a multiplicative factor, e.g., x2. To the best of our efforts we could not attribute the observed price gaps to currency, shipping, or taxation differences."

    "title":"Crying Wolf? On The Price Discrimination Of Online Airline Tickets"
    ,"link":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01081034/"
    ,"abstract":"Price discrimination refers to the practice of dynamically varying the prices of goods based on a customer's purchasing power and willingness to pay. In this paper, motivated by several anecdotal ac-counts, we report on a three-week experiment, conducted in search of price discrimination in airline tickets. Despite presenting the companies with multiple opportunities for discriminating us, and contrary to our expectations, we do not find any evidence for systematic price discrimi-nation. At the same time, we witness the highly volatile prices of certain airlines which make it hard to establish cause and effect. Finally, we provide alternative explanations for the observed price differences."

    ,"abstract":"This report first examines the nature of the players in the agricultural data ecosystem, and examinesthe scope for digital platforms to provide structure to establish a data market. Second, we tackle the notion that data is a natural public good, whereby value is maximised by sharing it openly. While this may work well for some types such as scientific research data (Sanderson et al. 2017), it should not be expected to apply universally to all data. Third, the costs and value potential of sharing agricultural are considered, and we derive particular implications for the scale at which data is aggregated. Finally, we review the institutional and incentive considerations which will be important as we move from an agricultural data ecosystem towards an Australian agricultural data market. "

    ,"abstract":"We study oligopolistic firms' incentives to share customer information about past purchase history when firms are uncertain about whether a particular consumer considers the product offerings as complements or substitutes. We show that both the incentive to share customer information and its effects on consumers depend crucially on the relative magnitudes of the prices that would prevail in the complementary and substitute markets if consumers were fully segmented according to their preferences. This paper has important implications for merger analysis when the primary motive for merger is the acquisition of another firm's customer lists. Our analysis also suggests a new role of middlemen as information aggregators."

    ,"abstract":"Firms sometimes try to 'poach' the current customers of their competitors by offering them special inducements to switch. We analyze duopoly poaching under both short-term and long-term contracts in two polar cases: either each consumer's brand preferences are constant from one period to the next, or preferences are independent over time. With fixed preferences, poaching induces socially inefficient switching, so welfare is highest when this form of price discrimination is banned; the equilibrium with longterm contracts has less switching than that when only short-term contracts are feasible, so here long-term contracts promote efficiency. With independent preferences, first-period choices do not provide a basis for second-period price discrimination, so the equilibrium with short-term contracts is simply two repetitions of the static equilibrium, and is thus efficient. However, the equilibrium in long-term contracts involves inefficiently little switching."

    ,"abstract":"We analyze how different degrees of privacy protection affect industry profits, consumer welfare, and total welfare in a model with switching costs. Firms earn higher profits under weak privacy protection compared with strong or no privacy protection. The relationship between the degree of privacy protection and equilibrium profits is not monotonic. Consumer surplus and total welfare increase with the degree of privacy protection unless firms recognize consumer‐specific switching costs. In that case, pricing conditional on switching costs has favorable implications for consumer surplus and total welfare."

The office of the city attorney of Los Angeles has filed suit against an IBM subsidiary for allegedly 'deceiving users' about the business unit's questionable data privacy practices, as the lawsuit states.

What factors contribute to the costing equation is not clearly understood with wide variation in methodologies used.

    "title":"Data As Essential Facility"
    ,"link":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34662689.pdf"
    ,"abstract":"The competitive strength of online businesses is increasingly being determined by the amount, variety and quality of the data they hold. Providers of online platforms such as search engines, social networks and e-commerce platforms employ business models that are dependent on the acquisition and monetisation of personal data of users. Many internet companies can be seen as so-called ‘multi-sided' platforms that bring users and advertisers together. By accumulating and analysing information about the behaviour and interests of users, providers of these platforms are able to improve their services to users in the form of more relevant search results, social interactions and purchase recommendations as well as to advertisers in the form of better targeted advertising. Datasets built on the basis of the information that individuals disclose when using online services have become an economic asset in the digital economy. Against this background, the thesis explores how existing competition concepts can be applied to data-related competition concerns in digital markets. The main focus is on potential refusals of dominant providers of online platforms to give access to their data. In line with its significance in the digital economy, data is becoming a necessary input of production for a variety of services competing with or complementary to the services offered by incumbent providers. By refusing to share information with potential competitors or new entrants, incumbents may limit effective competition and innovation to the detriment of consumers. In this context, the question rises whether such a denial of a dominant firm to grant competitors access to its dataset could constitute a refusal to deal under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and lead to competition law liability under the so-called ‘essential facilities doctrine'. Because of the particular nature of data collected by providers of online platforms and the new business models that are employed, potential refusals to share data give rise to new competition concerns. While the thesis concerns the application of EU competition law to a specific type of conduct, it also raises several broader and more fundamental issues including the appropriate analysis of multi-sided platforms under competition law, the trade-offs that have to be made between protecting different types of competition and innovation (competition in versus for the market; sustaining versus disruptive innovation), and the relationship between competition and data protection law. The thesis concludes that existing competition concepts are still fit for purpose in the digital  economy, provided that their application is adapted to the peculiarities of online platforms. Even though the necessary tools are available, competition authorities and courts have to be willing to employ them in such a way as to ensure that the competition analysis reflects the competitive reality of digital markets. To that end, recommendations are provided for bringing the application of competition law in line with the demands of dynamic markets and for adequately protecting consumer welfare in the online environment."

    ,"abstract":"The Internet of Things raises a number of so far unsolved legal and regulatory questions. Particularly important are the issues of privacy, data ownership, and data access. One particularly interesting example are connected cars with their huge amount of produced data. Also based upon the recent discussion about data ownership and data access in the context of the EU Communication 'Building a European data economy' this paper has two objectives: (1) It intends to provide a General economic theoretical framework for the analysis of data governance regimes for data in Internet of Things contexts, in which two levels of data governance are distinguished (private data governance based upon contracts and the legal and regulatory framework for markets). This framework focuses on potential market failures that can emerge in regard to data and privacy. (2) It applies this analytical framework to the complex problem of data governance in connected cars (with its different stakeholders car manufacturers, car owners, car component suppliers, repair service providers, insurance companies, and other service providers), and identifies several potential market failure problems in regard to this specific data governance problem (esp. competition problems, information/behavioral Problems and privacy problems). These results can be an important input for future research that focuses more on the specific policy implications for data governance in connected cars. Although the paper is primarily an economic paper, it tries to take into account important aspects of the legal discussion."

    ,"abstract":"Modern information systems not only capture a seemingly endless amount of transactional data, but also tend to retain it for indefinite periods of time. We argue that privacy policies must address not only collection and access to transactional information, but also its timely disposal. One unintended side effect of data retention is the disappearance of social forgetfulness, which allows individuals a second chance, the opportunity for a fresh start in life. We examine three domains in which social policy has explicitly recognized the importance of such a principle: bankruptcy law, juvenile crime records, and credit reports. In each case, we frame the issue in terms of the social benefits of forgetfulness, rather than in terms of individual privacy protection. We examine how different policy approaches to privacy might handle the retention of data and propose a comprehensive policy that includes a variety of strategies. The broad conclusion of the article is that data retention and disposal should be addressed as a part of a broader and comprehensive policy approach, rather than in a piecemeal fashion or as an afterthought."

This essay briefly describes the most prominent data science techniques that lend themselves to analyses of institutional and organizational governance structures. We elaborate on several examples applying data science to analyze legal, political, and social institutions and sketch how specific data science techniques can be used to study important research questions that could not (to the same extent) be studied without these techniques. We conclude by comparing the main strengths and limitations of computational social science with traditional empirical research methods and its relation to theory."

    ,"abstract":"This report reviews data-driven mergers by focusing on two main competition challenges associated with them. Departing from the economic characteristics of data-driven markets, we analyze the unreplicable competitive advantage that data-platforms may pose to entrants. Secondly, it reviews the intersection between competition and privacy and the quantification of the merger effects on consumer choice. The report argues that a more dynamic approach can contribute to address those challenges better than a pure static framework, and proposes a re-analysis of the European Commission's merger decision regarding Facebook/WhatsApp to test whether its outcome would have changed if a more forward-looking analysis were taken into account. The report concludes by summarizing the main takeaways and proposing that dynamic effects, consumer choice, and merger control be analyzed more holistically."

In this paper, we present a system called HostTracker that tracks dynamic bindings between hosts and IP addresses by leveraging application-level data with unreliable IDs. Using a month-long user login trace from a large email provider, we show that HostTracker can attribute most of the activities reliably to the responsible hosts, despite the existence of dynamic IP addresses, proxies, and NATs. With this information, we are able to analyze the host population, to conduct forensic analysis, and also to blacklist malicious hosts dynamically."

    ,"abstract":"This paper calls for an epistemic disobedience in privacy studies by decolonizing the approach to privacy. As technology companies expand their reach worldwide, the notion of privacy continues to be viewed through an ethnocentric lens. It disproportionately draws from empirical evidence on Western-based, white, and middle-class demographics. We need to break away from the market-driven neoliberal ideology and the Development paradigm long dictating media studies if we are to foster more inclusive privacy policies. This paper offers a set of propositions to de-naturalize and estrange data from demographic generalizations and cultural assumptions, namely, (1) predicting privacy harms through the history of social practice, (2) recalibrating the core-periphery as evolving and moving targets, and (3) de-exoticizing 'natives' by situating privacy in ludic digital cultures. In essence, decolonizing privacy studies is as much an act of reimagining people and place as it is of dismantling essentialisms that are regurgitated through scholarship."

We examine the role of one factor: the no-action default for agreement. We first argue that such decisions are constructed in response to the question, and therefore influenced by the form of the question. We then describe research that shows that presumed consent increases agreement to be a donor, and compare countries with opt-in (explicit consent) and opt-out (presumed consent) defaults. Our analysis shows that opt-in countries have much higher rates of apparent agreement with donation, and a statistically significant higher rate of donations, even with appropriate statistical controls. We close by discussing the costs and benefits associated with both defaults as well as mandated choice."

    ,"abstract":"There has been much literature written on the subject of clickstream data. However, very little has been discussed over the extent to which clickstream data is considered as 'personal data' under European and U.S. law. This Article considers the current European Union (EU) regulations governing clickstream data by examining the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPD) and the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2002/58/EC (DPEC), comparing these laws with the U.S legal framework. In particular, this Article discusses the broad application of the DPD under Article 4 and the notion of 'personal data' as defined under Article 2(a). The implications of the DPD should not be underestimated because the DPD can have overreaching effects by applying to companies or organizations operating outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'), principally through Article 4(1)(c). In addition, this Article surveys the applicable clickstream statutory regulatory frameworks by reviewing Title III of the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act ('Wiretap Act') and its progeny.This Article takes a critical approach to clickstream data by considering the current EU and U.S. regulatory frameworks for clickstream data and by analyzing the extent to which such data is protected.

    ,"abstract":"Price discrimination, setting the price of a given product for each customer individually according to his valuation for it, can benefit from extensive information collected online on the customers and thus contribute to the profitability of e-commerce services. Another way to discriminate among customers with different willingness to pay is to steer them towards different sets of products when they search within a product category (i.e., search discrimination). Our main contribution in this paper is to empirically demonstrate the existence of signs of both price and search discrimination on the Internet, and to uncover the information vectors used to facilitate them. Supported by our findings, we outline the design of a large-scale, distributed watchdog system that allows users to detect discriminatory practices."

    ,"abstract":"In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy."

    ,"abstract":"The methodology of differential privacy has provided a strong definition of privacy which in some settings, using a mechanism of doubly-exponential noise addition, also allows for extraction of informative statistics from databases. A recent paper extends this approach to the release of a specified set of margins from a multi-way contingency table. Privacy protection in such settings implicitly focuses on small cell counts that might allow for the identification of units that are unique in the database. We explore how well the mechanism works in the context of a series of examples, and the extent to which the proposed differential-privacy mechanism allows for sensible inferences from the released data."

    ,"abstract":"Online marketplaces often contain information not only about products, but also about the people selling the products. In an effort to facilitate trust, many platforms encourage sellers to provide personal profiles and even to post pictures of themselves. However, these features may also facilitate discrimination based on sellers' race, gender, age, or other aspects of appearance. In this paper, we test for racial discrimination against landlords in the online rental marketplace Airbnb. Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12% more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust."

    ,"abstract":"Effective use of the Internet as a crucial information and communication network is increasingly necessary to participate in society. This thesis analyzes differences in everyday Internet use and discusses their social implications. A sociological digital inequality perspective based on the knowledge gap hypothesis forms the main theoretical framework. It assumes that Internet use depends on and contributes to social position. Quantitative international surveys were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Network and automated content analysis were additionally used on web data. Results show that general Internet uses can be grouped into four core purposes (information seeking, social interaction, entertainment, and commercial transaction). For valid cross-country comparisons of usage types, measurement invariance testing was found critical. There are pronounced second-level digital divides with consistent age, education, and experience effects. Differences in specific online activities— privacy protection, political participation, and science participation— are mainly explained by interests and Internet skills, and these in turn depend on social position. Overall, Internet use tends to reinforce social inequalities but policies aimed at enhancing Internet skills may counter this. The consequences for individuals' subjective well-being is identified as a future avenue for empirical digital inequality research."

    "title":"Digital Market Manipulation"
    ,"link":"https://www.gwlr.org/calo/"
    ,"abstract":"In 1999, Jon Hanson and Douglas Kysar coined the term 'market manipulation' to describe how companies exploit the cognitive limitations of consumers. For example, everything costs $9.99 because consumers see the price as closer to $9 than $10. Although widely cited by academics, the concept of market manipulation has had only a modest impact on consumer protection law. This Article demonstrates that the concept of market manipulation is descriptively and theoretically incomplete, and updates the framework of the theory to account for the realities of a marketplace that is mediated by technology. Today's companies fastidiously study consumers and, increasingly, personalize every aspect of the consumer experience. Furthermore, rather than waiting for the consumer to approach the marketplace, companies can reach consumers anytime and anywhere. The result of these and related trends is that firms can not only take advantage of a general understanding of cognitive limitations, but can uncover, and even trigger, consumer frailty at an individual level. A new theory of digital market manipulation reveals the limits of consumer protection law and exposes concrete economic and privacy harms that regulators will be hard-pressed to ignore. This Article thus both meaningfully advances the behavioral law and economics literature and harnesses that literature to explore and address an impending sea change in the way firms use data to persuade."

    ,"abstract":"Humans devote 30–40% of speech output solely to informing others of their own subjective experiences. What drives this propensity for disclosure? Here, we test recent theories that individuals place high subjective value on opportunities to communicate their thoughts and feelings to others and that doing so engages neural and cognitive mechanisms associated with reward. Five studies provided support for this hypothesis. Self-disclosure was strongly associated with increased activation in brain regions that form the mesolimbic dopamine system, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Moreover, individuals were willing to forgo money to disclose about the self. Two additional studies demonstrated that these effects stemmed from the independent value that individuals placed on self-referential thought and on simply sharing information with others. Together, these findings suggest that the human tendency to convey information about personal experience may arise from the intrinsic value associated with self-disclosure."

Companies are under an increasing political pressure to notify individuals whose privacy as been breached. At the moment, we know virtually nothing about the behavioral impact of data breach notifications. We present the results of an experimental study designed to investigate how breach notifications change the individual's propensity to provide sensitive personal information to firms. In contrast to the theory (where breach notifications have no behavioral effect), our main result shows that notifications induce a sub-group of individuals to disclose less information to a firm, i.e. those with personally sensitive information."

How this works with the topcoding limit was shown using data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. "

    ,"abstract":"We review literature examining the effects of laws and regulations that require public disclosure of information. These requirements are most sensibly imposed in situations characterized by misaligned incentives and asymmetric information between, for example, a buyer and seller or an advisor and advisee. We review the economic literature relevant to such disclosure and then discuss how different psychological factors complicate, and in some cases radically change, the economic predictions. For example, limited attention, motivated attention, and biased assessments of probability on the part of information recipients can significantly diminish, or even reverse, the intended effects of disclosure requirements. In many cases, disclosure does not much affect the recipients of the information but does significantly affect the behavior of the providers, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. We review research suggesting that simplified disclosure, standardized disclosure, vivid disclosure, and social comparison information can all be used to enhance the effectiveness of disclosure policies."

    ,"abstract":"In the United States, identity theft resulted in corporate and consumer losses of $56 billion dollars in 2005, with up to 35 percent of known identity thefts caused by corporate data breaches. Many states have responded by adopting data breach disclosure laws that require firms to notify consumers if their personal information has been lost or stolen. Although the laws are expected to reduce identity theft, their effect has yet to be empirically measured. We use panel data from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to estimate the impact of data breach disclosure laws on identity theft from 2002 to 2009. We find that adoption of data breach disclosure laws reduce identity theft caused by data breaches, on average, by 6.1 percent."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2723693"
    ,"abstract":"The collection of user data online has seen enormous growth in recent years. Consumers have benefitted from the growth through an increase in free or heavily subsidized services, better quality offerings, and rapid innovation. At the same time, the debate about Big Data, and what it really means for consumers and competition, has grown louder. Many have focused on whether Big Data even presents an antitrust issue, and whether and how harms resulting from Big Data should be analyzed and remedied under the antitrust laws. The academic literature, however, has somewhat lagged behind the debate, and a closer inspection of existing scholarly works reveals a dearth of thorough study of the issue. Commentators generally split into two camps: one in favor of more proactive antitrust enforcement in the Big Data realm, and one opposing such intervention, considering antitrust inappropriate for regulation of Big Data. The academic case for the former has not, as yet, been fully developed, and is relatively light at present. Meanwhile, policy-focused work by academics practitioners in this arena suggests that antitrust intervention in Big Data would be premature and misguided, especially considering the myriad pro-competitive benefits offered by Big Data. In this handbook chapter, we review the scholarly work on the implications of Big Data on competition, and consider the potential role of antitrust in the regulation of Big Data. Part I provides an overview of current, scarce, academic literature specifically addressing the role of antitrust in Big Data issues. Parts II and III delve into the policy issues surrounding Big Data and whether it poses a risk to competition that warrants antitrust intervention. Part II details the ways in which Big Data may prove pro-competitive while Part III reviews and critiques the suggested potential harms to competition from Big Data. Part IV discusses the suitability of antitrust as the institutional choice for Big Data issues, and Part V concludes that, at present, antitrust is ill suited as the institutional choice. This conclusion is further born by the fact that thus far there have been no cases in the United States or Europe that have found Big Data itself to be a basis for a theory of harm on antitrust grounds for mergers or conduct cases. Further, the scholarly case for such harm has not yet been adequately established."

    ,"abstract":"In many markets firms have some information about their customers resulting from the consumers' past choice behavior. Given this information, firms can better target their market practices with respect to their customers. This article considers such a situation in a duopoly with infinitely lived firms and overlapping generations of consumers. Firms can set different prices for their previous customers and their new customers. A new customer may either have bought the competing product in the previous period or be new to the market. I identify three effects: (i) Firms lower prices to attract the competitor's previous customers. (ii) Greater consumer patience intensifies competition. (iii) Greater firm patience softens the competitive interaction. With patient firms and consumers, prices are lower than when there is no customer recognition. "

    ,"abstract":"Personal data market provides a promising way to deal with the conflict between exploiting the value of personal data and protecting individuals' privacy. However, determining the price of privacy is a tough issue. In this chapter, we study the pricing problem in a scenario where a data collector sequentially buys data from multiple data providers whose valuations of privacy are randomly drawn from an unknown distribution. To maximize the total payoff, the collector needs to dynamically adjust the prices offered to the providers. We model the sequential decision-making problem of the collector as a multi-armed bandit problem with each arm representing a candidate price. Specifically, the privacy protection technique adopted by the collector is taken into account. Protecting privacy generally causes a negative effect on the value of data, and this effect is embodied by the time-variant distributions of the rewards associated with arms. Based on the classic upper confidence bound policy, we propose two learning policies for the bandit problem. The first policy estimates the expected reward of a price by counting how many times the price has been accepted by data providers. The second policy treats the time-variant data value as a context and uses ridge regression to estimate the rewards in different contexts. Simulation results on real-world data demonstrate that by applying the proposed policies, the collector can get a payoff approximating to that he can get by setting a fixed price, which is the best in hindsight, for all data providers."

    ,"abstract":"We investigate in this paper whether dynamic targeted pricing based on consumer purchase history could benefit a practicing firm even when consumers are 'strategic' in that they actively seek to avail themselves of a low price in the future. Such strategic behavior on the part of consumers has been shown in the literature to render such dynamic targeted pricing unprofitable, even for a monopoly firm. We show that dynamic targeted pricing can benefit competing firms, when they actively pursue customer recognition based on consumer purchase history. This is because in order to pursue customer recognition, competing firms need to price high to 'screen out' price-sensitive consumers and hence price competition is moderated. As a result, all competing firms can become better off with targeted pricing than without even when consumers behave strategically. Interestingly, because of this competition moderation effect, the paradoxical outcome occurs where dynamic targeted pricing may not benefit a monopolist, but it may benefit competing firms. We also show that dynamic targeted pricing can expand the market such that social welfare unambiguously improves."

Surveillance capacity for such detection can be costly, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. Furthermore, there may be economic incentives for countries to not fully disclose the nature and extent of an outbreak.1 The Internet, however, is revolutionizing how epidemic intelligence is gathered, and it offers solutions to some of these challenges. Freely available Web-based sources of information may allow us to detect disease outbreaks earlier with reduced cost and increased reporting transparency."

    ,"abstract":"This doctoral thesis aims to advance our understanding of major topics of concern in the 21st century using theoretical as well as empirical economic methodologies. All three topics do and will continue to affect people's lives as they can substantially shape the functioning of our societies. Thematically linked, Chapter 2 and 3 both focus on privacy choices and their consequences in the context of big data algorithms that target individual consumers. In contrast, Chapter 3 and 4 are linked methodologically as both present results from economic laboratory experiments, where the former focuses on cognitive challenges of individual decision-makers and the latter on challenges to coordination and cooperation between decision-makers. Chapter 2 presents results from a theoretical model where consumers face a monopolistic seller who is not only capable of perfect price discrimination but also more strategically sophisticated than the consumers. The model shows that consumers use a costly privacy-protective sales channel even in the absence of an explicit taste for privacy if they are not too strategically sophisticated. Chapter 3 presents results from an economic laboratory experiment related to the model developed before. Finding substantial deviations from Nash equilibrium predictions. Addressing cognitive constraints often present in privacy choices, some evidence for two alternative explanations is found: level-k thinking and reinforcement learning. A policy treatment resembling privacy-by-default mechanisms leads to a strong increase in hiding behavior. Chapter 4 presents results from an economic laboratory experiment of a dynamic resource extraction game that mimics the global multi-generation planning problem for climate change and fossil fuel extraction. The findings from this experiment suggest that successful cooperation does not only need to overcome a gap between individual incentives and public interests. There is also a fundamental heterogeneity between subjects with respect to beliefs and preferences about the way in which this should be achieved."

    ,"abstract":"The large majority of digital goods, such as smartphone apps, are zero priced. To generate revenue, developers have to monetize their apps. However little is known about their strategies. We provide empirical evidence on the monetization strategies related to free apps by studying how the collection of personal data is combined with more traditional revenue sources such as advertising and in-app purchase. In particular, personal data are essential for Internet companies but their involvement in the smartphone applications market remains relatively unexplored. We have unique data to measure how apps are monetized, based on information related to free applications available on the Google Play Store platform combined with data on applications' privacy-related behaviors provided by Privacy Grade. We provide information on the third parties market behind mobile applications. We show that the economics of mobile applications and the third party economy should be considered together. Among the apps in our dataset, 9% collect personal data and use no other strategy. We also show that the increased number of downloads is associated to more data collection, hence apps with more than 1 billion downloads have a 24.2% probability of using users' personal data as a monetization strategy."

Despite its size, European economic policy has often lagged behind the rest of the world in its ability to generate growth and innovation. Much of the European economic research itself often trails behind that of the USA, which sets much of the agenda in mainstream economics. This book, also available as open access, bridges the gap between economic research and policymaking by presenting overviews of twelve key areas for future economic policy and research. Written for the economists and policymakers working within European institutions, it uses comprehensive surveys by Europe's leading scholars in economics and European policy to demonstrate how economic research can contribute to good policy decisions, and vice versa, demonstrating how economics research can be motivated and made relevant by hot policy questions."

Businesses are scrambling for advice on compliance; advisers in turn are hesitant to lay claim to water-tight, penalty-free solutions. Much of this uncertainty derives from a misconception of what this new European Union framework is mandating. Entities that come under the regulator's spotlight are not expected to have ideal template systems; rather, they should have in place a data-protection regime that corresponds to the scale of their undertaking and the forms of data processing they enact. Nevertheless, given the Regulation's ambiguities, it seems that a business's capacity to tailor appropriate measures through internal review could be the difference between a minor warning and an administrative penalty."

We ask how the expected costs of litigation affect decisions to adopt technologies, such as electronic medical records (EMRs), which leave more of an electronic trail. EMRs allow hospitals to document electronically both patient symptoms and health providers' reactions to those symptoms and may improve the quality of care that makes the net impact of their adoption on expected litigation costs ambiguous. This article studies the impact of state rules that facilitate the use of electronic records in court. We find evidence that hospitals are one-third less likely to adopt EMRs after these rules are enacted."

    ,"abstract":"Fast‐paced IT advances have made it increasingly possible and useful for firms to collect data on their customers on an unprecedented scale. One downside of this is that firms can experience negative publicity and financial damage if their data are breached. This is particularly the case in the medical sector, where we find empirical evidence that increased digitization of patient data is associated with more data breaches. The encryption of customer data is often presented as a potential solution, because encryption acts as a disincentive for potential malicious hackers, and can minimize the risk of breached data being put to malicious use. However, encryption both requires careful data management policies to be successful and does not ward off the insider threat. Indeed, we find no empirical evidence of a decrease in publicized instances of data loss associated with the use of encryption. Instead, there are actually increases in the cases of publicized data loss due to internal fraud or loss of computer equipment. "

    ,"abstract":"The security of sensitive individual data is a subject of indisputable importance. One of the major threats to sensitive data arises when one can link sensitive information and publicly available data. In this paper we demonstrate that even if the sensitive data are never publicly released, the point estimates from the empirical model estimated from the combined public and sensitive data may lead to a disclosure of individual information. Our theory builds on the work in Komarova, Nekipelov and Yakovlev (2011) where we analyze the individual disclosure that arises from the releases of marginal empirical distributions of individual data. The disclosure threat in that case is posed by the possibility of a linkage between the released marginal distributions. In this paper, we analyze a different type of disclosure. Namely, we use the notion of the risk of statistical partial disclosure to measure the threat from the inference on sensitive individual attributes from the released empirical model that uses the data combined from the public and private sources. As our main example we consider a treatment effect model in which the treatment status of an individual constitutes sensitive information."

    ,"abstract":"Personalized products and services in e-commerce bring consumers many new experiences, but also trigger a series of information security issues. Considering the bounded rationality of the game participants, in this paper, we propose an evolutionary game model of privacy protection between firms and consumers based on e-commerce personalization. Evolutionary stable strategies (ESSs) are obtained from the equilibrium points according to the model analysis, and then simulation experiments are launched to validate the decision-making results and the influencing mechanism of various factors. The results show that the model can eventually evolve toward a win-win situation by wisely varying its various factors, such as ratios of initial strategies, cost of privacy protection, commodity prices, and other related factors. Further, we find that reducing the possibility of the privacy breach under the premise of privacy protection can help promote the e-commerce personalization."

    ,"link":"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.short"
    ,"abstract":"Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people."

    ,"abstract":"The theory of markets and privacy begins with the understanding that the current crisis in the privacy of personal information is a result of market failure and not 'technological progress' alone. The market failure has occurred because of a poor social choice in the allocation of property rights. Under current law, the ownership right to personal information is given to the collector of that information, and not to the individual to whom the information refers. Individuals have no property rights in their own personal information. As a result, they cannot participate in the flourishing market for personal information, i-e., they receive no compensation for the uses of their personal information. As a fiuther consequence, the price of personal information is so low that informationintense industries become inefficient in its use. The price is low because the price of personal information does not reflect the true social costs of coping with personal information. The market is dominated by privacy-invading institutions. And as a fbrther result, there is a disturbing growth in privacy invasion, an excessive and abusive disregard for the interests of many in keeping elements of their life private, or at least under their control.

    ,"abstract":"Social media platforms provide unique opportunities for brands to directly engage with customers and advertise their products. As the largest social network, Facebook gains the majority of its revenue by having companies pay for their messages to appear in the users' newsfeeds. The foundation for most marketing activities has been shown to be proper market segmentation. To that end, marketers can specify a targeted Facebook user group by selecting particular demographic characteristics and like objects. Currently, however, no research has provided any guidance on how to differentiate various target groups. We intend to analyze and classify the Facebook profiles based on their demographic, psychometric, lifestyle and value, as well as geographic information that can be derived from their profiles. Thereby, we will identify key marker items that determine the distinct user segments. Marketers can then apply these items in order to properly target their advertisement campaigns."

This paper presents the first tool addressing this challenge, the Facebook Data Valuation Tool (FDVT). The FDVT provides Facebook users with a personalized and real-time estimation of the revenue they generate for Facebook. Relying on the FDVT, we are able to shed light into several relevant HCI research questions that require a data valuation tool in place. The obtained results reveal that (i) there exists a deep lack of awareness among Internet users regarding the monetary value of personal information, (ii) data valuation tools such as the FDVT are useful means to reduce such knowledge gap, (iii) 1/3 of the users testing the FDVT show a substantial engagement with the tool."

    ,"abstract":"In this paper, we study the effects of a self-regulatory effort, orchestrated by the European Commission, that aims to reduce advertising revenues for publishers of copyright infringing content. Historical data lets us follow how the third-party advertising and tracking services associated with a large number of piracy websites and a corresponding set of legitimate 'placebo' websites change after the agreement to self-regulate went in place. We find that larger EU-based advertisers comply with the initiative and reduce their connections with piracy websites. We do not find reductions for other non-advertising services that track consumers, which has potentially important implications for the efficiency of targeted advertising."

    ,"abstract":"Online copyright enforcement, in the form of either direct action against the supply- side (via website shutdowns) or the demand-side (via individual lawsuits against users), has not been very effective in reducing piracy. Regulators have therefore put forward the so called 'follow the money' approach. Because the main source of revenue for infringing websites often comes from online advertising, the idea is that cutting access to advertisers could lower the financial incentives for website owners. In this paper, we aim to provide systematic evidence on the effectiveness of such a policy. We collect data on the advertising services associated with a large number of piracy websites and corresponding set of legitimate placebo websites before and after the _rst steps of a self-regulatory effort in the European Union went in place. Preliminary results suggest that advertising services indeed reduce their activities on piracy websites, however only those that are most likely to be directly affected by the regulation. We further provide evidence that some advertising services that did not cater to the piracy market before, start to do soperhaps as a strategic response."

    ,"abstract":"Upon the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) application on 25 May 2018 across the European Union, new legal requirements for the protection of personal data will be enforced for data controllers operating within the EU territory. While the principles encompassed by the GDPR were mostly welcomed, two of them, namely the right to withdraw consent and the right to be forgotten, caused prolonged controversy among privacy scholars, human rights advocates and business world due to their pivotal impact on the way personal data would be handled under the new legal provisions and the drastic consequences of enforcing these new requirements in the era of big data and internet of things. In this work, we firstly review all controversies around the new stringent definitions of consent revocation and the right to be forgotten in reference to their implementation impact on privacy and personal data protection, and secondly, we evaluate existing methods, architectures and state-of-the-art technologies in terms of fulfilling the technical practicalities for the implementation and effective integration of the new requirements into current computing infrastructures. The latter allow us to argue that such enforcement is indeed feasible provided that implementation guidelines and low-level business specifications are put in place in a clear and cross-platform manner in order to cater for all possible exceptions and complexities."

In this instance we are considering the value of a well established methodology, cross methodology, adopted from macroeconomics and ideas from political science. The cross methodology is used as a means of considering if the relationship between data collected for security proposes and individual privacy. We argue that this relationship is moving towards a symbiotic relationship and away from a synergistic one. In the article we present a model which we transform using system thinking and applying it within the context of security and privacy at the strategic level. The article is about the relationship between security, information and control and the effect that increased surveillance has upon individual privacy and freedom."

    ,"abstract":"Online social networks have made sharing photos and other digital content a common activity. Recently, a range of novel online services and connected devices have expanded the set of 'things' to share – ranging from new types of digital content like music preferences and workout data to physical things like household items ('sharing economy'). To understand user needs, concerns and preferences in such emerging sharing domains, we collected 200 responses about participants' experiences with sharing six categories of 'things': music preferences; travel plans; sports activity; real-world items (e.g., rooms and vehicles); virtual items in online games; and dietary preferences. For each category, we systematically describe what our participants share and with whom. Additionally, we asked 56 'non-sharers' to describe their reasons to refrain from sharing personal content from these categories. Using qualitative analysis methods, we use information from both 'sharers' and 'non-sharers' to identify privacy concerns that frame content sharing, and we discuss how factors like audience perception and sharing controls should inform the design of newly emerging sharing services."

    ,"abstract":"Trust is particularly important in online markets to facilitate the transfer of sensitive consumer information to online retailers. In electronic markets, various proposals have been made to facilitate these information transfers. We develop analytic models of hidden information to analyze the effectiveness of these regimes to build trust and their efficiency in terms of social welfare. We find that firms' ability to influence consumer beliefs about trust depends on whether firms can send unambiguous signals to consumers regarding their intention of protecting privacy. Ambiguous signals can lead to a breakdown of consumer trust, while the clarity and credibility of the signal under industry self-regulation can lead to enhanced trust and improved social welfare. Our results also indicate that although overarching government regulations can enhance consumer trust, regulation may not be socially optimal in all environments because of lower profit margins for firms and higher prices for consumers."

    ,"abstract":"Public information about one's coworkers, friends, family, and acquaintances, as well as one's associations with them, implicitly reveals private information. Social-networking websites, e-mail, instant messaging, telephone, and VoIP are all technologies steeped in network data—data relating one person to another. Network data shifts the locus of information control away from individuals, as the individual's traditional and absolute discretion is replaced by that of his social-network. Our research demonstrates a method for accurately predicting the sexual orientation of Facebook users by analyzing friendship associations. After analyzing 4,080 Facebook profiles from the MIT network, we determined that the percentage of a given user's friends who self-identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the sexual orientation of that user, and we developed a logistic regression classifier with strong predictive power. Although we studied Facebook friendship ties, network data is pervasive in the broader context of computer-mediated communication, raising significant privacy issues for communication technologies to which there are no neat solutions."

    ,"abstract":"Marriott data breach is under investigation in several countries, where the hotel and resorts giant has a presence. In the E.U., Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) leads the investigation. It is the UK independent body set up to uphold information rights. Local authorities of each country are interested to participate as 'supervisory authorities' in the cooperative framework of GDPR. According to ICO as the investigation is at an early stage no official attribution has been made. Given that the global annual revenue of the company reached $22.89 billion in 2017 and the strictest fine could amount to 4% of it, the sanctions imposed by the E.U. could be translated to $915 million. This will probably add up to the amount of $3.5 billion, analysts initially estimated some days after the incident went public. In addition, it is possible that some clients may take legal action against the company and claim damages which will elevate the cost of the breach even higher. In the worst case scenario if it is proved that the company was fully aware of the hacker attack well before it was revealed, then the Securities and Exchange Commission of the U.S. will pursue a prosecution against Marriott on the grounds of causing serious losses for its investors."

    ,"abstract":"The European Union's stringent regime governing how data collectors gather and use its citizens' information and give consumers more control took effect Friday. It's known as the General Data Protection Regulation and covers any company that has EU residents' personal data. That means businesses from neighborhood restaurants and hotels to Amazon to Google have been scrambling for months to make sure they comply to avoid penalties that can go as high as nearly $25 million or 4 percent of global annual revenue -- a hefty sum for the likes of Facebook, which endured a tough round of questioning by EU politicians just days before the rules took effect demanding to know how the social-media titan will apply the new rules."

    ,"abstract":"With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) arriving within weeks, businesses are now in the final sprint to achieve compliance before the May 25 deadline. As most people know by now, GDPR is a global data protection law passed by the European Union that shifts the ownership of customer data from the organizations that use it to the individual customer. This new regulation not only applies to European businesses that work with the customer data of EU citizens -- it applies to any entities that work with said businesses as well, thus making GDPR a global data protection law. The stakes are high, as failure to comply results in a hefty fine of 20 million Euros or 4% of the company's global revenue, whichever is larger. With Facebook's recent misuse of its customer data, all eyes are on the proper protection of customers' private information."

    ,"link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11936"
    ,"abstract":"Recent research has proposed the use of Semi Adversarial Networks (SAN) for imparting privacy to face images. SANs are convolutional autoencoders that perturb face images such that the perturbed images cannot be reliably used by an attribute classifier (e.g., a gender classifier) but can still be used by a face matcher for matching purposes. However, the generalizability of SANs across multiple arbitrary gender classifiers has not been demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we tackle the generalization issue by designing an ensemble SAN model that generates a diverse set of perturbed outputs for a given input face image. This is accomplished by enforcing diversity among the individual models in the ensemble through the use of different data augmentation techniques. The goal is to ensure that at least one of the perturbed output faces will confound an arbitrary, previously unseen gender classifier. Extensive experiments using different unseen gender classifiers and face matchers are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed paradigm in imparting gender privacy to face images."

    ,"abstract":"Individual, personalized genetic information is increasingly available, leading to the possibility of greater adverse selection over time, particularly in individual-payer insurance markets. We use data on individuals at risk for Huntington disease (HD), a degenerative neurological disorder with significant effects on morbidity, to estimate adverse selection in long-term care insurance. We find strong evidence of adverse selection: individuals who carry the HD genetic mutation are up to 5 times as likely as the general population to own long-term care insurance. This finding is supported both by comparing individuals at risk for HD to those in the general population and by comparing across tested individuals in the HD-risk population with and without the HD mutation."

    ,"link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05911"
    ,"abstract":"There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined ∼2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of ∼3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 × 10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10-5 and 5 × 10-7) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research."

    ,"abstract":"Research on the effects of personalized messages on consumers' behavioral responses has yielded mixed findings. We explore how e-mail personalization influences click-through intentions. Our results suggest that consumers experience personalization reactance in response to highly personalized messages when the fit between the offer in the message and consumers' personal characteristics is not explicitly justified by firms. Consequently, consumers are less willing to respond favorably to the offer. Results of two studies suggest that this effect primarily emerges for consumers who perceive the utility of the service to be relatively low. For those consumers with higher perceived utility, justification of personalization is less important because highly personalized messages are less likely to elicit reactance."

    ,"abstract":"We model a competitive labor market with heterogeneous firms of varying productivities, and consider two information-collection processes: searching for 'good news' about applicants, and searching for 'bad news.' Under the former, firms seek positive signals to qualify applicants, and under the latter, negative signals to disqualify them. When searching for good news, firms collect too little information in equilibrium; however, aggregate profits are positive and applicants' choice of firms is efficient. When searching for bad news, firms collect too much information, profits dissipate, and applicants inefficiently match with firms of lower productivities. In both cases, too few applicants are admitted. We show that firms tend to search for good (bad) news for low (high) revenue positions. Moreover, as the cost of acquiring information decreases, applicants' expected payoffs rise and more firms search for good news."

    ,"abstract":"Google Flu Trends (GFT) is a novel Internet-based influenza surveillance system that uses search engine query data to estimate influenza activity and is available in near real time. This study assesses the temporal correlation of city GFT data to cases of influenza and standard crowding indices from an inner-city emergency department (ED). This study was performed during a 21-month period (from January 2009 through October 2010) at an urban academic hospital with physically and administratively separate adult and pediatric EDs. We collected weekly data from GFT for Baltimore, Maryland; ED Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–reported standardized influenzalike illness (ILI) data; laboratory-confirmed influenza data; and ED crowding indices (patient volume, number of patients who left without being seen, waiting room time, and length of stay for admitted and discharged patients). Pediatric and adult data were analyzed separately using cross-correlation with GFT. GFT correlated with both number of positive influenza test results (adult ED, r = 0.876; pediatric ED, r = 0.718) and number of ED patients presenting with ILI (adult ED, r = 0.885; pediatric ED, r = 0.652). Pediatric but not adult crowding measures, such as total ED volume (r = 0.649) and leaving without being seen (r = 0.641), also had good correlation with GFT. Adult crowding measures for low-acuity patients, such as waiting room time (r = 0.421) and length of stay for discharged patients (r = 0.548), had moderate correlation with GFT. City-level GFT shows strong correlation with influenza cases and ED ILI visits, validating its use as an ED surveillance tool. GFT correlated with several pediatric ED crowding measures and those for low-acuity adult patients."

This, the researcher suggested — and The A.P. confirmed — did not work as advertised. 'Some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking,' the reporters found.

    ,"abstract":"This paper displays data from the US and its top 40 trading partners on the search volume of select keywords from before and after the surveillance revelations of June 2013, to analyze whether Google users' search behavior changed as a result. The surveillance revelations are treated as an exogenous shock in information about how closely users' internet searches were being monitored by the US government. Each search term was independently rated for its degree of privacy sensitivity along multiple dimensions. Using panel data, our results suggest that search terms that were deemed both personally-sensitive and government-sensitive were most negatively affected by the PRISM revelations, highlighting the interplay between privacy concerns relating to both the government and the private individual. Perhaps surprisingly, the largest `chilling effects' were not found in countries conventionally treated as intelligence targets by the US, but instead in countries that were more likely to be considered allies of the US. We show that this was driven in part by a fall in searches on health-related terms. Suppressing health information searches potentially harms the health of search engine users and, by reducing traffic on easy-to-monetize queries, also harms search engines' bottom line. In general, our results suggest that there is a chilling effect on search behavior from government surveillance on the Internet, and that government surveillance programs may damage the profitability of US-based internet firms relative to non-US-based internet firms."

    ,"abstract":"In this paper, we predict hateful content as well as estimate the causal link between anonymity and hateful content in civic discussions online. First, we make use of a supervised machine-learning model to predict hate in general, hate against foreigners and hate against females and feminists on a dominating Swedish Internet discussion forum. Second, using a difference-in-difference model, we show that an exogenous decrease in anonymity leads to a less hateful content in general and less hate against foreigners, but an increase in the hate against females and feminists. The mechanisms behind the changes constitute a combination of a decrease in writing in a hateful way, as well as a decrease in writing in general and a substitution of hate against one group with another.

    ,"abstract":"When a firm can recognize its previous customers, it may use information about their past purchases to price discriminate. We study a model with a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers have the ability to maintain their anonymity and avoid being identified as past customers, possibly at a cost. When consumers can freely maintain their anonymity, they all individually choose to do so, which results in the highest profit for the monopolist. Increasing the cost of anonymity can benefit consumers but only up to a point, after which the effect is reversed. We show that if the monopolist or an independent third party controls the cost of anonymity, it often works to the detriment of consumers."

    ,"abstract":"Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole. The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising. We propose a difference-in-differences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components. Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates. We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestimation of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000%."

    ,"abstract":"Legal and institutional differences shape the ownership and terms of bank loans across the world. We show that under strong creditor protection, loans have more concentrated ownership, longer maturities, and lower interest rates. Moreover, the impact of creditor rights on loans depends on borrower characteristics such as the size and tangibility of assets. Foreign banks appear especially sensitive to the legal and institutional environment, with their ownership declining relative to domestic banks as creditor protection falls. Our multidimensional empirical model paints a more complete picture of how financial contracts respond to the legal and institutional environment than existing studies."

    ,"abstract":"India is at a critical juncture as cities and governments in general move into the digital age in order not only to provide enhanced services, but to improve transparency and efficiency, and as this development is taking place at a time when the Supreme Court bench has decided in August, 2017 that privacy is a constitutional right. It is in this context that this research asks the following question: how can cities (a state actor) use citizen data to maximize the governance while protecting the citizens fundamental right to privacy? We examine how this balance and tradeoffs arise due to the way Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) collect, use, and disclose citizen data. For the investigation, we collect ULB metadata by examining the architecture of the products of eGovernments Foundation, one of the leading providers of digital tools for ULBs, and by directly by interacting with ULBs. Based on this investigation, we define two new indices, a Governance Efficiency Index (GEI) and a Information Privacy Index (IPI), that allows for measuring city's performance on the two dimensions, understanding where tensions arise in simultaneously improving performance on both, and where innovation will overcome such tensions. In addition, to being able to make specific observations and recommendations for the particular cases we examined, this work is a proof of concept that such analysis can and should be done more widely, in order to understand the tradeoffs between government transparency and efficiency on one hand, and privacy on the other."

There are orders of magnitude more data outside an agency's firewall than inside it—compromising the integrity of traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods. And increasingly the information processed by the agency was 'asked' in a context wholly outside the agency's operations—blurring the distinction between what was asked and what is published. Already, private businesses like Microsoft, Google and Apple recognize that cybersecurity (safeguarding the integrity and access controls for internal data) and privacy protection (ensuring that what is published does not reveal too much about any person or business) are two sides of the same coin. This is a paradigm-shifting moment for statistical agencies."

    ,"abstract":"Identity theft is made possible by the nature of modern payment systems. In the modern economy, sellers are willing to offer goods and services to strangers in exchange for a promise to pay, provided the promise is backed up by data that link the buyer to a specific account or credit history. Identity theft involves acquiring enough data about another person to counterfeit this link, enabling the thief to acquire goods while attributing the charge to another person's account. In this article, we discuss what is (and is not) known about the prevalence and cost of identity theft, describe the institutional framework in which identity theft takes place, and consider some of the main policy issues associated with the problem."

    "title":"Identity Theft, Privacy, And The Architecture Of Vulnerability"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=416740."
    ,"abstract":"This Article contrasts two models for understanding and protecting against privacy violations. Traditionally, privacy violations have been understood as invasive actions by particular wrongdoers who cause direct injury to victims. Victims experience embarrassment, mental distress, or harm to their reputations. Privacy is not infringed until these mental injuries materialize. Thus, the law responds when a person's deepest secrets are exposed, reputation is tarnished, or home is invaded. Under the traditional view, privacy is an individual right, remedied at the initiative of the individual. In this Article, Professor Solove contends the traditional model does not adequately account for many of the privacy problems arising today. These privacy problems do not consist merely of a series of isolated and discrete invasions or harms, but are systemic in nature. They cannot adequately be remedied by individual rights and remedies alone. In contrast, Professor Solove proposes a different model for understanding and protecting against these privacy problems. Developing the notion of 'architecture' as used by Joel Reidenberg and Lawrence Lessig, Solove contends that many privacy problems must be understood as the product of a broader structural system which shapes the collection, dissemination, and use of personal information. Lessig and Reidenberg focus on 'architectures of control,' structures that function to exercise greater dominion over individuals. Solove argues that in addition to architectures of control, we are seeing the development of 'architectures of vulnerability,' which create a world where people are vulnerable to significant harm and are helpless to do anything about it. Solove argues that protecting privacy must focus not merely on remedies and penalties but on shaping architectures. Professor Solove illustrates these points with the example of identity theft, one of the most rapidly growing types of criminal activity. Identity theft is often conceptualized under the traditional model as the product of disparate thieves and crafty criminals. The problem, however, has not been adequately conceptualized, and, as a result, enforcement efforts have been misdirected. The problem, as Solove contends, is one created by an architecture, one that creates a series of vulnerabilities. This architecture is not created by identity thieves; rather, it is exploited by them. It is an architecture of vulnerability, one where personal information is not protected with adequate security. The identity thief's ability to so easily access and use our personal data stems from an architecture that does not provide adequate security to our personal information and that does not afford us with a sufficient degree of participation in the collection, dissemination, and use of that information. Understanding identity theft in terms of architecture reveals that it is part of a larger problem that the law has thus far ignored. Solove then discusses solutions to the identity theft problem. He engages in an extensive critique of Lynn LoPucki's solution, which involves the creation of a public identification system. After pointing out the difficulties in LoPucki's proposal, Solove develops an architecture that can more appropriately curtail identity theft, an architecture based on the Fair Information Practices."

    ,"abstract":"Despite a statutory definition of identity theft, there is a continuing debate on whether differences among the financial frauds associated with identity theft warrant further distinction and treatment, not only by lenders and financial institutions but also by consumers and regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In this Discussion Paper, Julia S. Cheney examines four types of financial fraud - fictitious identity fraud, payment card fraud, account takeover fraud, and true name fraud - that fall under the legal term identity theft to better understand how criminal behavior patterns, risks for consumers and lenders, and mitigation strategies vary depending upon the sort of data stolen, the type of account compromised, and the opportunity for financial gain. Three areas key to developing effective solutions that, in the view of the author, would benefit from further definitional delineations are identified: measuring the success (or failure) of efforts to fight this crime, educating consumers about the risks and responses to this crime, and coordinating mitigation strategies across stakeholders and geographies."

However, as data collection and processing continue to soar -- and there are no signs the consent requirement will slow data growth -- organizations are increasingly challenged to secure the data they process, as required by Article 32 of the regulation."

    ,"link":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w22203"
    ,"abstract":"We analyze the costs and benefits of using social image to foster virtuous behavior. A Principal seeks to motivate reputation-conscious agents to supply a public good. Each agent chooses how much to contribute based on his own mix of public-spiritedness, private signal about the value of the public good, and reputational concern for appearing prosocial. By making individual behavior more visible to the community the Principal can amplify reputational payoffs, thereby reducing free-riding at low cost. Because societal preferences constantly evolve, however, she knows only imperfectly both the social value of the public good (which matters for choosing her own investment, matching rate or legal policy) and the importance attached by agents to social esteem and sanctions. Increasing publicity makes it harder for the Principal to learn from what agents do (the 'descriptive norm') what they really value (the 'prescriptive norm'), thus presenting her with a tradeoff between incentives and information aggregation. We derive the optimal degree of privacy/publicity and matching rate, then analyze how they depend on the economy's stochastic and informational structure. We show in particular that in a fast-changing society (greater variability in the fundamental or the image-motivated component of average preferences), privacy should generally be greater than in a more static one."

    ,"abstract":"Online social networks such as Friendster, MySpace, or the Facebook have experienced exponential growth in membership in recent years. These networks offer attractive means for interaction and communication, but also raise privacy and security concerns. In this study we survey a representative sample of the members of the Facebook (a social network for colleges and high schools) at a US academic institution, and compare the survey data to information retrieved from the network itself. We look for underlying demographic or behavioral differences between the communities of the network's members and non-members; we analyze the impact of privacy concerns on members' behavior; we compare members' stated attitudes with actual behavior; and we document the changes in behavior subsequent to privacy-related information exposure. We find that an individual's privacy concerns are only a weak predictor of his membership to the network. Also privacy concerned individuals join the network and reveal great amounts of personal information. Some manage their privacy concerns by trusting their ability to control the information they provide and the external access to it. However, we also find evidence of members' misconceptions about the online community's actual size and composition, and about the visibility of members' profiles."

This paper studies the impact of privacy on free online service markets by augmenting the classical Hotelling model for market segmentation analysis. A parametrized game-theoretic model is proposed which captures: (i) the fact that for the free service market, consumers value service not in monetized terms but by the quality of service (QoS); (ii) the differentiator of services is not product price but the privacy risk advertised by an SP; and (iii) consumer's heterogeneous privacy preference for SPs. For the two-SP problem with uniformly distributed consumer privacy preference and linear SP profit function, the results suggest that: (i) when consumers place a higher value on privacy, it leads to a larger market share for the SP providing untargeted services and a 'softened' competition between SPs; (ii) SPs offering high privacy risk services are sustainable only if they offer sufficiently high QoS; and (iii) SPs that are capable of differentiating on services that do not directly use consumer data gain larger market share. Similar results are observed when the consumer's privacy preference is modeled as a truncated Gaussian distribution."

    ,"abstract":"A well established principle arms that the privacy of individuals is respected whenever they are entitled to control the dissemination of their personal data and they are fairly compensated. From this perspective, quantifying the value of personal data is a crucial task in the Internet economics. This task is dicult, however, as the privacy attitude of the users is often characterized by a contradictory behavior, known as the privacy paradox, in which they declare to be sensitive to privacy losses but also often release large amounts of data to enjoy free services. In this paper, we model this trade-off as a local public good game and propose some quantifications of the users' personal data depending on their position in the social network, based on enhancing an efficient solution of the local public good model. In a first part, we present some non-cooperative approaches, based on an internalization of the local externalities. In a second part, we extend the model to a cooperative game and we apply some well-known solutions from cooperative game theory to suggest fair ways to compensate the users and to perform a network analysis."

    "title":"Individual Marketing With Imperfect Targetability"
    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.20.1.23.10201"
    ,"abstract":"Our research investigates the competitive ramifications of individual marketing and information management in today's information-intensive marketing environments. The specific managerial issues we address are as follows. First, what kinds of incentive environments do competing firms face when they can only target individual customers imperfectly? Second, does the improvement in an industry's targetability intensify price competition in the industry such that all competing firms become worse off? Third, should a firm share its customer knowledge so as to improve its rival's targetability? Fourth, how should an information vendor sell its information that can improve a firm's targetability? Finally, do competing firms have the same incentives to invest in their own targetability? To answer those questions, we develop a simple model à la Narasimhan (1988), in which each of the two competing firms have their own loyal customers and compete for common switchers. We assume that each firm can classify its own loyal customers and switchers correctly only with a less-than-perfect probability. This means that each firm's perceived customer segmentation differs from the actual customer segmentation. Based on their perceived reality, these two competing firms engage in price competition. As an extension, we also allow the competing firms to make their investment decisions to acquire targetability. We show that when individual marketing is feasible, but imperfect, improvements in targetability by either or both competing firms can lead to win-win competition for both even if both players behave noncooperatively and the market does not expand. Win-win competition results from the fact that as a firm becomes better at distinguishing its price-insensitive loyal customers from the switchers, it is motivated to charge a higher price to the former. However, due to imperfect targetability, each firm mistakenly perceives some price-sensitive switchers as price-insensitive loyal customers and charges them all a higher price. These misperceptions thus allow its competitors to acquire those mistargeted customers without lowering their prices and, hence, reduce the rival firm's incentive to cut prices. This effect softens price competition in the market and qualitatively changes the incentive environment for competing firms engaged in individual marketing. A 'prisoner's dilemma' occurs only when targetability in a market reaches a sufficiently high level. This win-win perspective on individual marketing has many managerial implications. First, we show that superior knowledge of individual customers can be a competitive advantage. However, this does not mean that a firm should always protect its customer information from its competitors. To the contrary, we find that competing firms can all benefit from exchanging individual customer information with each other at the nascent stage of individual marketing, when firms' targetability is low. Indeed, under certain circumstances, a firm may even find it profitable to give away this information unilaterally. However, as individual marketing matures (as firms' targetability becomes sufficiently high), further improvements in targetability will intensify price competition and lead to prisoner's dilemma. Therefore, it is not only prudent politics but also a business imperative for an industry to seize the initiative on the issue of protecting customer privacy so as to ensure win-win competition in the industry. Second, we show that the firm with a larger number of loyal customers tends to invest more in targetability when the cost of acquiring targetability is high. However, the firm with a smaller loyal base can, through information investment, acquire a higher level of targetability than the firm with a larger loyal base as long as the cost of acquiring targetability is not too high. As the cost further decreases, competing firms will all have more incentives to increase their investments in targetability until they achieve the highest feasible level. Third, an information vendor should make its information available nonexclusively (exclusively) when its information is associated with a low (high) level of targetability. When the vendor does sell its information exclusively, it should target a firm with a small loyal following if it can impart a high level of targetability to that firm. Finally, our analysis shows that an information-intensive environment does not doom small firms. In fact, individual marketing may provide a good opportunity for a small firm to leapfrog a large firm. The key to leapfrogging is a high level of targetability or customer knowledge."

    ,"abstract":"How do price commitments impact the amount of information firms acquire about potential customers? We examine this question in the context of a competitive market where firms search for information that may disqualify applicants. Contracts are incomplete because the amount of information acquired cannot be observed. Despite competition, we find that firms search for too much information in equilibrium. If price discrimination is prohibited, members of high-risk groups suffer disproportionately high rejection rates. If rejected applicants remain in the market, the resulting adverse selection can be severe. We apply the results to the US mortgage market."

    ,"abstract":"Some economists think the Coase theorem implies a lot about the proper scope of government intervention in the economy and about the welfare consequences of laissez-faire. Others see it as a mere tautology: that if people negotiate efficiently then every outcome will be efficient. The Coase theorem is important only if we believe that efficient negotiation is likely. Of course we can attribute inefficiencies to 'bargaining imperfection,' but it may not be useful to do so. Such attitudes sometimes seem to depend more on ideology than on reason. This article gives one economist's reasoned view. It discusses the Coase Theorem as a decentralization result and why decentralization results are interesting. It considers mechanism design for revealing private information, and describes the problems of centralization. Should the Coase theorem should be viewed as a second-best result -- property rights are more efficient than some reasonable alternative? Does the Coase theorem recommend an institution or make institutions unnecessary?"

As the worker becomes older the number of potential employers may shrink more often than it grows, but the number will seldom fall to even a thousand. No worker, unless his degree of specialization is pathological, will ever be able to become informed on the prospective earnings which would be obtained from every one of these potential employers at any given time, let alone keep this information up to date.

All this information can enhance market efficiency and consumer surplus as firms tailor products to buyers. But, there is increased risk of information loss. What issues should be on the Digital Agenda with regard to information loss, and what data are available to inform and generate incentives for consumer, business, and policy interactions in the information marketplace? This paper reviews the situation and points out where we need more thought and more data. Topics include: (1) Frameworks for analysis: How should we model the information marketplace, particularly with regard to the benefits and costs of information aggregation and protection? (2) Quantification and data: What is the evidence on the prevalence and nature of information loss, and what are the costs of information loss, and to whom? (3) Market and Policy Response: What do we know about the efficacy of market vs. other approaches to incentivize market participants to avoid loss or remediate after information loss? Throughout, of particular interest is the international dimension of the information marketplace. What issues arise when countries differ in their attitudes and policies toward the information marketplace?"

    ,"abstract":"As the costs of generating and transmitting information fall, the main bottlenecks in communication networks are becoming the human receivers, who are overloaded with information. For networks of targeted communication, this paper discusses the meaning of information overload, provides a theoretical treatment of its causes, and examines mechanisms for allocating the attention of receivers. Mechanisms for allocating attention include surcharges on communication and auctions. These mechanisms increase the cost of sending messages and shift the task of screening messages from the receivers to the senders. This shift may benefit both the receivers and the senders because the senders know the contents of the messages whereas the receivers do not. We show that, if the communication cost is low, then an increase in the communication cost benefits most (but not all) receivers. The increase benefits all the senders if either the extra cost is a tax that is redistributed to them as lump-sum transfers or the senders' information about the receivers is sufficiently accurate."

    ,"abstract":"This research addresses the tensions that arise between the collection and use of personal information that people provide in the course of most consumer transactions, and privacy. In today's electronic world, the competitive strategies of successful firms increasingly depend on vast amounts of customer data. Ironically, the same information practices that provide value to organizations also raise privacy concerns for individuals. This study hypothesized that organizations can address these privacy concerns and gain business advantage through customer retention by observing procedural fairness: customers will be willing to disclose personal information and have that information subsequently used to create consumer profiles for business use when there are fair procedures in place to protect individual privacy. Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior. Our hypothesis was supported as we found that when customers are explicitly told that fair information practices are employed, privacy concerns do not distinguish consumers who are willing to be profiled from those who are unwilling to have their personal information used in this way."

    "title":"Information Privacy Litigation As Bellwether For Institutional Change"
    ,"link":"https://via.library.depaul.edu/law-review/vol66/iss2/9/"
    ,"abstract":"Information privacy litigation is controversial and headline-grabbing. New class complaints are filed seemingly every few weeks. Legal scholars vie with one another to articulate more comprehensive theories of harm that such lawsuits might vindicate. Large information businesses and defense counsel bemoan the threats that information privacy litigation poses to corporate bottom lines and to 'innovation' more generally. For all that, though, the track record of litigation achievements on the information privacy front is stunningly poor. This Article examines emerging conventions for disposing of information privacy claims, including denial of standing, enforcement of boilerplate waivers, denial of class certification, disposal via opaque multidistrict litigation proceedings, and cy pres settlements. It argues that, in an era of complex, informationally-mediated harms, the information privacy lawsuit is a marker of both institutional stress and institutional opportunity. The inability of most information privacy claims to gain meaningful traction reflects the influence of powerful repeat players interested in minimizing their exposure to claims of informational injury. But it also raises important questions about how judicial processes can be adapted to deal with the predominantly informational and infrastructural harms that increasingly characterize our networked, information-based political economy."

    "title":"Information Privacy/Information Property"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=218274"
    ,"abstract":"From most objective standpoints, protecting information privacy though industry self-regulation is an abject failure. The current political climate has been hostile to proposals for meaningful privacy regulation. Privacy advocates have been casting around for some third alternative and a number of them have fastened on the idea that data privacy can be cast as a property right. People should own information about themselves, and, as owners of property, should be entitled to control what is done with it. The essay explores that proposal. I review the recent enthusiasm for protecting data privacy as if it were property, and identify some of the reasons for its appeal. I examine the model and conclude that a property rights approach would be unlikely to improve matters; indeed, it would tend to encourage the market in personal data rather than constraining it. After critiquing the property model, I search for a different paradigm, and explore the possibility that tort law might support a workable approach to data privacy. Current law does not provide a tort remedy for invasion of data privacy, but there are a number of different strands in tort jurisprudence that might be extended to encompass one. In particular, a rubric based loosely on breach of confidence might persuade courts to recognize at least limited data privacy rights. I conclude, however, that while the tort solution is preferable to a property rights approach, it is likely to offer only modest protection. Common law remedies are by their nature incremental, and achieving widespread adoption of novel common law causes of action is inevitably a slow process. Even established common law remedies, moreover, are vulnerable to statutory preemption. Although a rash of state tort law decisions protecting data privacy might supply the most compelling impetus to federal regulation we are likely to achieve, the resulting protection scheme is unlikely to satisfy those of us who believe that data privacy is worth protecting."

    "title":"Information Privacy: Corporate Management And National Regulation"
    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.1.35.12567"
    ,"abstract":"The 1990s have seen a resurgence of interest in information privacy. Public opinion surveys show that many citizens are becoming greatly concerned about threats to their information privacy, with levels of such concern reaching all-time highs. Perhaps as a response to the growing concerns of citizens, the media are devoting more attention to privacy issues, and governmental regulation of the corporate privacy environment is increasing in many countries. Almost all developed countries have grappled with the trade-offs between open access to information—which enables economic efficiency—and an individual's right to privacy. Consistent with these trade-offs, many recent incidents suggest that regulatory approaches to information privacy, corporate management of personal data, and consumer reactions are becoming tightly interwoven around the world. To provide some insights into these relationships, we develop a conceptual model and test it with a cross-cultural sample from 19 different countries. In general, we find that a country's regulatory approach to the corporate management of information privacy is affected by its cultural values and by individuals' information privacy concerns. In addition, as governments become more involved in the corporate management of information privacy, internal management of such issues seems to tighten. This result supports previous observations that most firms take a primarily reactive approach to managing privacy by waiting for an external threat before crafting cohesive policies that confront their information practices. Moreover, when corporations are not perceived to adequately manage information privacy issues, and/or when privacy concerns rise, individuals are more inclined to prefer government intervention and be distrustful of firm self-regulation. As such, citizens may look to lawmakers to enact stricter regulation to reduce their privacy concerns. These findings and several international trends suggest that the self-regulatory model of privacy governance may not be sustainable over the long term. Findings from this research constitute an important contribution to the emerging theoretical base of information privacy research and should be particularly enlightening to those managing information privacy issues. Several directions for future research are also discussed."

    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292106000183"
    ,"abstract":"We analyze information sharing with repeated banking competition. In the presence of switching costs we find that information sharing renders poaching more profitable in future rounds of competition, since the poaching activities can be targeted towards (more) creditworthy borrowers. We find that information sharing reduces relationship benefits, and, therefore relaxes competition for initial market shares. Information sharing introduces a welfare tradeoff by promoting equilibrium profits at the expense of talented entrepreneurs whenever market power persists in credit market, whereas it is a matter of indifference without market power. Thus information sharing may induce exclusion of creditworthy borrowers from credit markets."

    ,"abstract":"We present a model with adverse selection where information sharing between lenders arises endogenously. Lenders' incentives to share information about borrowers are positively related to the mobility and heterogeneity of borrowers, to the size of the credit market, and to advances in information technology; such incentives are instead reduced by the fear of competition from potential entrants. In addition, information sharing increases the volume of lending when adverse selection is so severe that safe borrowers drop out of the market. These predictions are supported by international and historical evidence in the context of the consumer credit market."

    ,"abstract":"Theory predicts that information sharing among lenders attenuates adverse selection and moral hazard, and can therefore increase lending and reduce default rates. Using a new, purpose-built data set on private credit bureaus and public credit registers, we find that bank lending is higher and credit risk is lower in countries where lenders share information, regardless of the private or public nature of the information sharing mechanism. We also find that public intervention is more likely where private arrangements have not arisen spontaneously and creditor rights are poorly protected."

    ,"abstract":"In this paper we study the role of promotional expenditures by sellers in a model of product differentiation. Advertising conveys full and accurate information about the characteristics of products. Heterogeneous consumers, who have no source of information other than advertisements, seek to purchase the products that best fit their needs. Despite the roles played by advertising in improving the matching of products and consumers, and in increasing the elasticity of demand faced by each firm, we find that the market-determined Jevels of advertising are excessive, given the extent of diversity in the market. We derive a promotional equilibrium based on a specific information transmission technology, paying explicit attention to the structure of consumer information and its impact on firms' demand curves. This allows us to study the effects of changes in the advertising technology, including an increased ability to target messages to specific groups of consumers, on the equilibrium in the product market. We find that decreased advertising costs may reduce profits by increasing the severity of price competition."

    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404804000136"
    ,"abstract":"The increasing use of personal information in web-based applications has created privacy concerns worldwide.  This has led to awareness among policy makers in several countries regarding the desirability of harmonizing privacy laws. The challenge with privacy legislation from an international perspective is that the Internet is virtually borderless but legislative approaches differ between countries. This paper presents a functional comparison between current privacy law in the European Union and in the United States, as such laws relate to regulation of websites and online service providers. In addition, we articulate the similarities and differences between the 2002 EU Directive 2002/58/EC, titled the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, which has been adopted by the EU but not implemented, and the proposed U.S. Online Privacy Protection Act.  Using a qualitative approach, we use the Fair Information Practices to organize discussion of comparisons and contrasts between U.S. and EU privacy laws.  Our investigation of this topic leads us to conclude that the right of privacy is more heavily protected in the EU than in the U.S.  The Online Privacy Protection Act, recently introduced as a bill in Congress, has the potential to significantly effect commercial practices in the U.S. and move the U.S. toward current EU privacy protection laws.  This analysis benefits managers as well as security professionals since the results can be used to ensure that their organization's website practices are consistent with countries in which they exchange information.

    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1040.0032"
    ,"abstract":"The lack of consumer confidence in information privacy has been identified as a major problem hampering the growth of e-commerce. Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions—namely, collection, control, and awareness—exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet."

    ,"abstract":"During the past decade, the problems involving information privacy – the ascendance of Big Data and fusion centers, the tsunami of data security breaches, the rise of Web 2.0, the growth of behavioral marketing, and the proliferation of tracking technologies – have become thornier. Policymakers have proposed and passed significant new regulation in the United States and abroad, yet the basic approach to protecting privacy has remained largely unchanged since the 1970s. Under the current approach, the law provides people with a set of rights to enable them to make decisions about how to manage their data. These rights consist primarily of rights to notice, access, and consent regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data. The goal of this bundle of rights is to provide people with control over their personal data, and through this control people can decide for themselves how to weigh the costs and benefits of the collection, use, or disclosure of their information. I will refer to this approach to privacy regulation as 'privacy self-management.'"

    ,"link":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92925-5_5"
    ,"abstract":"The increased popularity of interconnected devices, which we rely on when performing day-to-day activities expose people to various privacy harms. This paper presents findings from the empirical investigation of privacy concerns. The study revealed that people, regardless of their diversity, perceive privacy harms as generic and simplified models, not individually as suggested in Solove's framework. Additionally, the results identified differences in privacy concerns related to information disclosure, protection behavior, and demographics. The findings may benefit privacy and system designers, ensuring that policies and digital systems match people's privacy expectations, decreasing risks and harms."

    ,"abstract":"Why do many digital firms rely on collecting consumer information–a practice that survey evidence shows is widely disliked? Why don't they, instead, charge a fee that would protect privacy? This paper empirically adjudicates between two competing hypotheses. The first holds that firms pursue this strategy because consumers are ill-informed and thus susceptible to exploitation. The second holds that this strategy reasonably approximates consumer preferences. By means of survey, I test a.) the extent of information asymmetry in digital markets, b.) consumers' valuation of privacy, and c.) whether government failure contributes to consumer mistrust of information collection. My results indicate that a.) the extent of information asymmetry is minimal, b.) there is significant divergence between 'notional' and 'real' demand for privacy and c.) that government contributes to consumer distrust of information collection by private firms. Significantly, almost 82% of Google users are unwilling to pay anything for increased digital privacy. "

    ,"abstract":"While the infosec economics literature has begun to investigate the stock market impact of security breaches and vulnerability announcements, little more than anecdotal evidence exists on effects of privacy breaches. In this paper we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of a company's privacy incidents on its market value. We compile a broad data set of instances of exposure of personal information from a failure of some security mechanism (hacking, stolen or lost equipment, poor process, and others) and we present the results of various empirical analyses, including event study analysis. We show that there exists a negative and statistically significant impact of data breaches on a company's market value on the announcement day for the breach. The cumulative effect increases in magnitudes over day following the breach announcement, but then decreases and loses statistical significance. We also present regression analyses that aim at disentangling the effects of a number of factors on abnormal stock returns due to reported breaches. Finally, we comment on the differences between the impact of the security breaches already described in the literature, and the privacy breaches described here."

    ,"abstract":"This chapter discusses job market signaling. The term market signaling is not exactly a part of the well-defined, technical vocabulary of the economist. The chapter presents a model in which signaling is implicitly defined and explains its usefulness. In most job markets, the employer is not sure of the productive capabilities of an individual at the time he hires him. The fact that it takes time to learn an individual's productive capabilities means that hiring is an investment decision. On the basis of previous experience in the market, the employer has conditional probability assessments over productive capacity with various combinations of signals and indices. This chapter presents an introduction to Spence's more extensive analysis of market signaling."

    ,"abstract":"There is an ongoing debate about the wisdom of allowing employers to use criminal history records in the employment screening process. The debate typically places the rights of individuals with criminal history records against the rights of employers concerned about hiring workers who might be inclined to commit crime in the workplace. The author argues that such a characterization of the debate is too narrow. In particular, this article uses a simple economic analysis to argue that employer access to criminal history records might actually increase the wages of individuals without criminal history records and may, moreover, increase average market wages for groups of individuals with large number of convicted individuals, such as Black males. This theory is tested by exploiting cross-state variation in policies governing employer access to criminal history records."

    ,"abstract":"The EU project BioMedBridges has built an infrastructure to allow interoperability between data and services in the biological, medical, translational and clinical research domains. Most databases in research infrastructures employ some form of data curation and data protection or are in the process of developing one. However, by enabling interoperability between infrastructures and by linking and merging different databases, data protection is lifted to a new and higher level. Openly accessible bio-molecular and structural data may become linked to data that is and has to remain protected, such as patient data. To address this challenge, using a novel approach, concepts from computer science were employed to create legal requirements clusters for data sharing. First, legal interoperability is defined as a specification of the general interoperability concept; second, data bridges are interpreted as interfaces; third, requirements engineering were used to create requirement clusters for data protection/ privacy, data security, Intellectual Property (IP) and licenses and security of biosamples. The requirement clusters were applied to a usage scenario of a cross-species phenotypic data bridge employing data amendments, phenotypic metadata and data linkage. All combined requirement clusters represent a knowledge base that can be added to workflow applications, software tools or databases to inform researchers about legally compliant data sharing."

    ,"abstract":"Credit registers collect, store and share information regarding borrowers' past and current credit relations. Interestingly, such data is typically erased from the public records after a number of years, in accordance with privacy protection laws, which aim at providing individuals with a fresh start from past events. In order to secure credit-worthy but unlucky borrowers with a new beginning, however, these provisions end up removing all of the public information, including that possibly still relevant for screening purposes. This paper assesses such trade-off, by studying the impact of limited records on borrowers' behavior and market outcomes in a stylized credit market for unsecured loans. In this setup, limited records endogenously give rise to beneficial reputation effects in the form of higher equilibrium effort, which alleviate, rather than worsen, the distortions caused by asymmetric information. Further, we demonstrate that when moral hazard is high, 1-period records can achieve higher welfare and lead to a lower default rate than records that show all, or nothing, of the past history."

    ,"abstract":"This reader aims to present a framework by which it becomes possible to enhance the responsibility of new technologies. The proposed framework is called a sociotechnical value map (STVM) and it combines insights from different disciplines, bringing about quite some challenges. The first chapter will present the philosophical and ethical foundations of the framework. It will explore why it is necessary to think about responsibility in relation to technology, as well as it will give an indication on how to increase the responsibility of new technology development. In the second chapter, the STVM itself will be outlined as a way to find the relevant values regarding a new technology. Moreover, the STVM is intended to give recommendations on how to actually adjust the innovation process so that it caters to responsible innovation. In the third chapter, the main contributions from science and technology studies and innovation economics will be represented, which are the social theories that underlie the STVM. Chapter four will present the main innovation policies that have been developed over the years that guide innovation processes in a way that is more societally responsive and desirable."

    ,"link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05380"
    ,"abstract":"The emerging marketplace for online free services in which service providers earn revenue from using consumer data in direct and indirect ways has lead to significant privacy concerns. This leads to the following question: can the online marketplace sustain multiple service providers (SPs) that offer privacy-differentiated free services? This paper studies the problem of market segmentation for the free online services market by augmenting the classical Hotelling model for market segmentation analysis to include the fact that for the free services market, a consumer values service not in monetized terms but by its quality of service (QoS) and that the differentiator of services is not product price but the privacy risk advertised by a SP. Building upon the Hotelling model, this paper presents a parametrized model for SP profit and consumer valuation of service for both the two- and multi-SP problems to show that: (i) when consumers place a high value on privacy, it leads to a lower use of private data by SPs (i.e., their advertised privacy risk reduces), and thus, SPs compete on the QoS; (ii) SPs that are capable of differentiating on services that do not directly target consumers gain larger market share; and (iii) a higher valuation of privacy by consumers forces SPs with smaller untargeted revenue to offer lower privacy risk to attract more consumers. The work also illustrates the market segmentation problem for more than two SPs and highlights the instability of such markets."

We oﬀer a comprehensive view of information markets through an integrated model of consumers, information intermediaries, and ﬁrms. The model embeds a large set of applications ranging from sponsored search advertising to credit scores to information sharing among competitors. We then review a mechanism design approach to selling information in greater detail. We distinguish between ex ante sales of information (the buyer acquires an information structure) and ex post sales (the buyer pays for speciﬁc realizations). We relate this distinction to the diﬀerent products that brokers, advertisers, and publishers use to trade consumer information online. We discuss the endogenous limits to the trade of information that derive from its potential adverse use for consumers. Finally, we revisit the role of recommender systems and artiﬁcial intelligence systems as markets for indirect information."

    ,"abstract":"We study markets for sensitive personal information. An agent wants to communicate with another party but any revealed information can be intercepted and sold to a third party whose reaction harms the agent. The market for information induces an adverse sorting effect, allocating the information to those types of third parties who harm the agent most. In equilibrium, this limits information transmission by the agent, but never fully deters it. We also consider agents who naively provide information to the market. Their presence renders traded information more valuable and, thus, harms sophisticated agents by increasing the third party's demand for information. Half-baked regulatory interventions may hurt naive agents without helping sophisticated agents. Comparing monopoly and oligopoly markets, we find that oligopoly is often better for the agent: it requires a higher value of traded information and therefore has to grant the agent more privacy."

Longstanding defects in Starwood's database and network security allowed attackers to capture names, addresses, dates of birth, passport numbers, communication preferences, arrival and departure information, and more.  In short, an exceedingly valuable trove of data for the attackers. Marriott has followed the by-now familiar data breach announcement playbook: it apologized, promised customers it cares about security, provided a website and dial-in number, and also offered credit monitoring."

Out-of- sample predictions of offline matches, i.e., marriages, exhibit assortative mating patterns similar to those observed in actual marriages.

    "title":"Measuring Attitude Towards Personal Data For Adaptive Cybersecurity"
    ,"link":"https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/ICS-11-2016-0085"
    ,"abstract":"This paper presents an initial development of a personal data attitude (PDA) measurement instrument based on established psychometric principles. The aim of the research was to develop a reliable measurement scale for quantifying and comparing attitudes towards personal data that can be incorporated into cybersecurity behavioural research models. Such a scale has become necessary for understanding individuals' attitudes towards specific sets of data, as more technologies are being designed to harvest, collate, share and analyse personal data. An initial set of 34 five-point Likert-style items were developed with eight subscales and administered to participants online. The data collected were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and MANOVA. The results are consistent with the multidimensionality of attitude theories and suggest that the adopted methodology for the study is appropriate for future research with a more representative sample. Factor analysis of 247 responses identified six constructs of individuals' attitude towards personal data: protective behaviour, privacy concerns, cost-benefit, awareness, responsibility and security. This paper illustrates how the PDA scale can be a useful guide for information security research and design by briefly discussing the factor structure of the PDA and related results. This study addresses a genuine gap in research by taking the first step towards establishing empirical evidence for dimensions underlying personal data attitudes. It also adds a significant benchmark to a growing body of literature on understanding and modelling computer users' security behaviours."

    "title":"Measuring Emotional Contagion In Social Media"
    ,"link":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142390"
    ,"abstract":"Social media are used as main discussion channels by millions of individuals every day. The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions."

    ,"abstract":"Third-party networks collect vast amounts of data about users via web sites and mobile applications. Consolidations among tracker companies can significantly increase their individual tracking capabilities, prompting scrutiny by competition regulators. Traditional measures of market share, based on revenue or sales, fail to represent the tracking capability of a tracker, especially if it spans both web and mobile. This paper proposes a new approach to measure the concentration of tracking capability, based on the reach of a tracker on popular websites and apps. Our results reveal that tracker prominence and parent-subsidiary relationships have significant impact on accurately measuring concentration."

    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1100.1210"
    ,"abstract":"Online personalization services belong to a class of economic goods with a 'no free disposal' (NFD) property where consumers do not always prefer more services to less because of the privacy concerns. These concerns arise from the revelation of information necessary for the provision of personalization services. We examine vendor strategies in a market where consumers have heterogeneous concerns about privacy. In successive generalizations, we allow the vendor to offer a fixed level of personalization, variable levels of personalization, and monetary transfers (coupons) to the consumers that depend on the level of personalization chosen. We show that a vendor offering a fixed level of personalization does not offer a coupon unless his marginal value of information (MVI) is sufficiently high, and even when personalization is costless, the vendor does not cover the market. Under a fixed services offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing. Next, we demonstrate that in the absence of couponing, the vendor's optimal variable personalization services contract maximizes surplus for all heterogeneous consumers, which is in contrast to standard results from monopolistic screening. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary according to personalization levels, the optimal contract is not fully revealing unless his MVI is high and he will not offer coupons when this MVI is low. However, a vendor with a moderate MVI (between certain thresholds) offers a bunched contract, wherein consumers with low privacy concerns receive a variable services-coupon contract, those with moderate privacy concerns receive a fixed services-coupon contract, and those with high privacy concerns do not participate in the market. The coupon value is decreasing in privacy sensitivity of consumers."

    "title":"Mechanism Design In Large Games: Incentives And Privacy"
    ,"link":"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2554834"
    ,"abstract":"We study the problem of implementing equilibria of complete information games in settings of incomplete information, and address this problem using 'recommender mechanisms.' A recommender mechanism is one that does not have the power to enforce outcomes or to force participation, rather it only has the power to suggestion outcomes on the basis of voluntary participation. We show that despite these restrictions, recommender mechanisms can implement equilibria of complete information games in settings of incomplete information under the condition that the game is large---i.e. that there are a large number of players, and any player's action affects any other's payoff by at most a small amount. Our result follows from a novel application of differential privacy. We show that any algorithm that computes a correlated equilibrium of a complete information game while satisfying a variant of differential privacy---which we call joint differential privacy---can be used as a recommender mechanism while satisfying our desired incentive properties. Our main technical result is an algorithm for computing a correlated equilibrium of a large game while satisfying joint differential privacy. Although our recommender mechanisms are designed to satisfy game-theoretic properties, our solution ends up satisfying a strong privacy property as well. No group of players can learn 'much' about the type of any player outside the group from the recommendations of the mechanism, even if these players collude in an arbitrary way. As such, our algorithm is able to implement equilibria of complete information games, without revealing information about the realized types."

We study the effects of erasing past records on trade and welfare in a dynamic market where each seller's quality follows a Markov process and buyers leave feedback about sellers. When the average quality of sellers is low, unlimited records always lead to a market breakdown. Appropriately deleting records, instead, can sustain trade in the long run. Positive and negative records play very different roles, and welfare is maximized for short positive records and long but bounded negative records."

    ,"abstract":"Most parallel programs today are written using threads and shared variables. Although there is no consensus on parallel programming models, there are a number of reasons why threads remain popular. Threads were already widely supported by mainstream operating systems well before the dominance of multicore, largely because they are also useful for other purposes. Direct hardware support for shared-memory potentially provides a performance advantage; for example, by implicitly sharing read-mostly data without the space overhead of complete replication. The ability to pass memory references among threads makes it easier to share complex data structures. Finally, shared-memory makes it far easier to selectively parallelize application hot spots without complete redesign of data structures."

    ,"abstract":"We consider a problem of matching guests with suitable hosts in a dynamic, directed search market in which a visitor's private taste and plans are subject to change. Guests learn about hosts by visiting them personally, which reveals whether the destination merits a repeat visit. Hosts prefer to target guests with high willingness to pay but, assuming full privacy, cannot tell whether they should rely on previous visitors or hold a sale to attract new visitors. We find that guests' private learning reduces matching frictions by sustaining longer visits to particularly fitting destinations. The strength of this effect depends on competition intensity. We also discover that a ban of tracking and targeting technologies may reduce consumer surplus. Specifically, access to visitor data enables their earlier hosts to respond more rapidly to demand changes, which can intensify competition and put downward pressure on prices."

Several horizontal and vertical dynamics that may impede or violate people's privacy when communicating in novel networked environments are identified. On the horizontal level, these include the increased risks of information dissemination to unwanted audiences and the convergence of formerly distinct social spheres. On the vertical level, these refer to the commodification of information and its evocation of data collection and surveillance practices."

    ,"link":"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3986210"
    ,"abstract":"The historic European Union Directive on Data Protection will take effect in October 1998. A key provision will prohibit transfer of personal information from Europe to other countries if they lack 'adequate' protection of privacy. If enforced as written, the Directive could create enormous obstacles to commerce between Europe and other countries, such as the United States, that do not have comprehensive privacy statutes. In this book, Peter Swire and Robert Litan provide the first detailed analysis of the sector-by-sector effects of the Directive. They examine such topics as the text of the Directive, the tension between privacy laws and modern information technologies, issues affecting a wide range of businesses and other organizations, effects on the financial services sector, and effects on other prominent sectors with large transborder data flows. In light of the many and significant effects of the Directive as written, the book concludes with detailed policy recommendations on how to avoid a coming trade war with Europe. The book will be of interest to the wide range of individuals and organizations affected by the important new European privacy laws. More generally, the privacy clash discussed in the book will prove a major precedent for how electronic commerce and world data flows will be governed in the Internet Age."

    ,"abstract":"Data is nonrival: a person's location history, medical records, and driving data can be used by any number of firms simultaneously without being depleted. Nonrivalry leads to increasing returns and implies an important role for market structure and property rights. Who should own data? What restrictions should apply to the use of data? We show that in equilibrium, firms may not adequately respect the privacy of consumers. But nonrivalry leads to other consequences that are less obvious. Because of nonrivalry, there may be large social gains to sharing data across firms, even in the presence of privacy considerations. Fearing creative destruction, firms may choose to hoard data they own, leading to the inefficient use of nonrival data. Instead, giving the data property rights to consumers can generate allocations that are close to optimal. Consumers appropriately balance their concerns for privacy against the economic gains that come from selling data to all interested parties."

    "title":"Notification Of Data Security Breaches"
    ,"link":"https://repository.law.umich.edu/mlr/vol105/iss5/2/"
    ,"abstract":"The law increasingly requires private companies to disclose information for the benefit of consumers. The latest examples of such regulation are state and federal laws that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving their personal information. These laws, proposed in the wake of highly publicized data spills, seek to punish the breached entity and to protect consumers by requiring the entity to notify its customers about the security breach. There are competing approaches, however to how the law is to mandate release of information about data leaks. This Article finds that the current statutes'focus on reputational sanction is incomplete. An important function of breach notification is mitigation of harm after a data leak. This function requires a multiinstitutional coordinated response of the kind that is absent from current policy proposals. This Article advocates creation of a coordinated response architecture and develops the elements of such an approach. Central to this architecture is a coordinated response agent (CRA) that oversees steps for automatic consumer protection and heightens mitigation. This Article also proposes a bifurcated notice scheme that lets firms know that the CRA is watching and is scrutinizing their decision whether or not to disclose information about a breach to the affected individuals. Moreover the CRA will set in motion automatic protective measures on behalf of the breached consumers. Finally, the CRA will regulate the content of notification messages to reflect the nature of the data breach."

    ,"abstract":"Advancements in information technology often task users with complex and consequential privacy and security decisions. A growing body of research has investigated individuals' choices in the presence of privacy and information security tradeoffs, the decision-making hurdles affecting those choices, and ways to mitigate such hurdles. This article provides a multi-disciplinary assessment of the literature pertaining to privacy and security decision making. It focuses on research on assisting individuals' privacy and security choices with soft paternalistic interventions that nudge users toward more beneficial choices. The article discusses potential benefits of those interventions, highlights their shortcomings, and identifies key ethical, design, and research challenges."

    ,"link":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47413-7_11"
    ,"abstract":"We propose a model, based on the work of Brock and Durlauf, which looks at how agents make choices between competing technologies, as a framework for exploring aspects of the economics of the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies. In order to formulate a model of decision-making among choices of technologies by these agents, we consider the following: context, the setting in which and the purpose for which a given technology is used; requirement, the level of privacy that the technology must provide for an agent to be willing to use the technology in a given context; belief, an agent's perception of the level of privacy provided by a given technology in a given context; and the relative value of privacy, how much an agent cares about privacy in this context and how willing an agent is to trade off privacy for other attributes. We introduce these concepts into the model, admitting heterogeneity among agents in order to capture variations in requirement, belief, and relative value in the population. We illustrate the model with two examples: the possible effects on the adoption of iOS devices being caused by the recent Apple–FBI case; and the recent revelations about the non-deletion of images on the adoption of Snapchat."

    ,"abstract":"This paper analyzes how fake news may have an effect on individual decisionmaking in the political sphere. To this end, arguments from the standard model of voter behaviour with full rationality are discussed as well as arguments from Behavioural Political Economy, which incorporates systematic psychological biases. It is argued that, by and large, the main problem resulting from fake news will not be persuasion, but confirmation. Individuals may demand fake news in order to confirm settled beliefs that they already hold. In a next step, the possible unintended consequences of extensive regulation of fake news are discussed. It is argued that, besides standard arguments such as rent-seeking, a major problem is that the government takes a paternalistic stance towards citizens. Also, the vagueness of the concept of fake news implies that a prosecution of fake news providers or distributors will suffer from arbitrariness and lead to an erosion of free speech. Finally, it is shown that the existing empirical evidence on the vulnerability of citizens for manipulation through fake news does not warrant any major government intervention into the political discourse."

    ,"abstract":"This paper considers an environment where two principals sequentially contract with a common agent and studies the exchange of information between the two bilateral relationships. We show that when (a) the upstream principal is not personally interested in the decisions taken  by the downstream principal, (b) the agent's exogenous private information has a 'vertical' structure in the sense that the sign of the single crossing condition is the same for upstream and downstream decisions, and (c) preferences in the downstream relationship are separable, then the upstream principal optimally commits to full privacy, whatever price the downstream principal is willing to pay to receive information. On the contrary, when any of the above conditions is violated, the upstream principal may find it strictly optimal to disclose a (noisy) signal of the agent's exogenous type and/or the result of his upstream contractual activity, even if she can not make the downstream principal pay for the information she receives. We also show that  disclosure does not necessarily reduce the equilibrium payoff of the agent and may lead to a Pareto improvement for the three players."

    ,"abstract":"Despite tremendous debate and policy interest, there has been relatively little research into the issue of how much individuals value their privacy. In this paper, I estimate the demand for the value of privacy from telemarketing as provided by the federal 'do not call' registry. From the demand curve, I compute two estimates of the household value of privacy: a lower bound of $3.22 per year, and a best estimate of $8.25 per year. The telemarketing industry must provide consumers with at least this much expected consumer surplus to persuade them not to conceal themselves through the 'do not call' registry."

    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2301"
    ,"abstract":"The growing popularity of online dating websites is altering one of the most fundamental human activities: finding a date or a marriage partner. Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data–based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates 'weak signals' of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches."

    ,"abstract":"A randomized experiment with 1.6 million customers measures positive causal effects of online advertising for a major retailer. The advertising profitably increases purchases by 5%. 93% of the increase occurs in brick-and-mortar stores; 78% of the increase derives from consumers who never click the ads. Our large sample reaches the statistical frontier for measuring economically relevant effects. We improve econometric efficiency by supplementing our experimental variation with non-experimental variation caused by consumer browsing behavior. Our experiment provides a specification check for observational difference-in-differences and cross-sectional estimators; the latter exhibits a large negative bias three times the estimated experimental effect."

Prior to the auction, the platform decides whether to allow advertisers to access information about consumers (disclosure) or not (privacy). Disclosure improves the match between advertisers and consumers but increases product prices, even without price‐discrimination. We provide conditions under which disclosure or privacy is privately and/or socially optimal. When advertisers compete on the downstream market, disclosure can lead to an increase or a decrease in product prices depending on the nature of the information."

    "title":"Online Advertising: Analysis Of Privacy Threats And Protection Approaches"
    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366416307083"
    ,"abstract":"Online advertising, the pillar of the 'free' content on the Web, has revolutionized the marketing business in recent years by creating a myriad of new opportunities for advertisers to reach potential customers. The current advertising model builds upon an intricate infrastructure composed of a variety of intermediary entities and technologies whose main aim is to deliver personalized ads. For this purpose, a wealth of user data is collected, aggregated, processed and traded behind the scenes at an unprecedented rate. Despite the enormous value of online advertising, however, the intrusiveness and ubiquity of these practices prompt serious privacy concerns. This article surveys the online advertising infrastructure and its supporting technologies, and presents a thorough overview of the underlying privacy risks and the solutions that may mitigate them. We first analyze the threats and potential privacy attackers in this scenario of online advertising. In particular, we examine the main components of the advertising infrastructure in terms of tracking capabilities, data collection, aggregation level and privacy risk, and overview the tracking and data-sharing technologies employed by these components. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the most relevant privacy mechanisms, and classify and compare them on the basis of their privacy guarantees and impact on the Web."

    ,"link":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.2.603"
    ,"abstract":"One view of internet advertising, therefore, is that it will move increasingly toward finer and finer ad targeting, with every impression treated as distinct and unique. Indeed , if we distinguish without limit among users in different locations, with different past behavior, looking at different content, then every impression is different. But is this sort of differentiation the best way to organize well-functioning markets? What are the disadvantages to treating each impression separately? To put the problem in perspective, we begin by discussing the experience of a few other 'commodity' markets. We introduce the idea of conflation, in which similar but distinct products are treated as identical in order to make markets thick or reduce cherrypicking. We report some illustrative anecdotes of how excessive ad targeting can work out badly. We then describe some trade-offs in designing online advertising markets, and the ingredients for a theory of the optimal market organization. "

    ,"abstract":"We use data from a large-scale field experiment to explore what influences the effectiveness of online advertising. We find that matching an ad to website content and increasing an ad's obtrusiveness independently increase purchase intent. However, in combination, these two strategies are ineffective. Ads that match both website content and are obtrusive do worse at increasing purchase intent than ads that do only one or the other. This failure appears to be related to privacy concerns: the negative effect of combining targeting with obtrusiveness is strongest for people who refuse to give their income and for categories where privacy matters most. Our results suggest a possible explanation for the growing bifurcation in Internet advertising between highly targeted plain text ads and more visually striking but less targeted ads."

    "title":"Online Privacy"

    ,"abstract":"Privacy has often gained the headlines on the media in the last few years, due to the revelation of appalling invasions of what many citizens perceive as the private space of their own communications, behavior, and lifestyle. Privacy is especially in the spotlight when the online dimension is concerned with the almost endless stream of personal information that travels on the Internet. However, the apparent importance that online privacy has gained in the public discourse should not be taken as a demonstration that privacy problems are going to be solved any time soon. Furthermore, it could not be even taken as a proof of maturity in the comprehension of the problems. In fact, many privacy problems are becoming more intractable now in the modern online ecosystem than decades ago, when privacy emerged as a problem of industrialized societies. Online privacy is enmeshed with the dynamics of technology innovations, and with the shape of today's IT market, it is also entangled with the often fragile economics of the online advertising sector. At present, privacy depends to customers bounded rationality and, to put it simple, to the fact that for an individual, to manage her own online privacy specifically and timely without sacrificing to reap the benefits of the online ecosystem would be just overwhelming in the current setting. In this chapter, we discuss some particularly critical factors contributing to the problem of managing today's online privacy, followed by an introduction to some technical issues. In particular, we present in more details the case of the data broker industry, rather than the much more publicized cases of governmental surveillance and Internet-based data-centric corporations, because of its relatively lesser media exposition combined with an indisputable relevance for citizens' privacy. The problem of the informed consent and the dubbed privacy control paradox is discussed too for its centrality in almost all privacy policies and still underrated weakness. This leads us to show the complex and multidimensional nature of online privacy and the implication on policy making. In the section on privacy and technologies, we address the problem of online privacy both at the application level—by describing the current techniques used to collect a user's browsing history—and at the communication level—by discussing the methods available to defend against traffic analysis. Then, we highlight the security and privacy issues of mobile health applications."

    ,"abstract":"We study platform design in online markets in which buying involves a (nonmonetary) cost for consumers caused by privacy and security concerns. Firms decide whether to require registration at their website before consumers learn relevant product information. We derive conditions under which a monopoly seller benefits from ex ante registration requirements and demonstrate that the profitability of registration requirements is increased when taking into account the prospect of future purchases or an informational value of consumer registration to the firm. Moreover, we consider the effectiveness of discounts (store credit) as a means to influence the consumers' registration decision. Finally, we confirm the profitability of ex ante registration requirements in the presence of price competition."

    ,"link":"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.560"
    ,"abstract":"Advances in data collection and storage technologies have given rise to the customer data intermediary (CDI), a firm that collects customer data to offer customer-specific marketing services to marketers. With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI—a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers—using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services."

    ,"abstract":"A change in the audition procedures of symphony orchestras--adoption of 'blind' auditions with a 'screen' to conceal the candidate's identity from the jury--provides a test for sex-biased hiring. Using data from actual auditions, in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases the probability a woman will be advanced and hired. Although some of our estimates have large standard errors and there is one persistent effect in the opposite direction, the weight of the evidence suggests that the blind audition procedure fostered impartiality in hiring and increased the proportion women in symphony orchestras."

    ,"link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MIS0742-1222240202"
    ,"abstract":"The advent of the Internet has made the transmission of personally identifiable information more common and often unintended by the user. As personal information becomes more accessible, individuals worry that businesses misuse the information that is collected while they are online. Organizations have tried to mitigate this concern in two ways: (1) by offering privacy policies regarding the handling and use of personal information and (2) by offering benefits such as financial gains or convenience. In this paper, we interpret these actions in the context of the information-processing theory of motivation. Information-processing theories, also known as expectancy theories in the context of motivated behavior, are built on the premise that people process information about behavior-outcome relationships. By doing so, they are forming expectations and making decisions about what behavior to choose. Using an experimental setting, we empirically validate predictions that the means to mitigate privacy concerns are associated with positive valences resulting in an increase in motivational score. In a conjoint analysis exercise, 268 participants from the United States and Singapore face trade-off situations, where an organization may only offer incomplete privacy protection or some benefits. While privacy protections (against secondary use, improper access, and error) are associated with positive valences, we also find that financial gains and convenience can significantly increase individuals' motivational score of registering with a Web site. We find that benefits—monetary reward and future convenience—significantly affect individuals' preferences over Web sites with differing privacy policies. We also quantify the value of Web site privacy protection. Among U.S. subjects, protection against errors, improper access, and secondary use of personal information is worth $30.49-$44.62. Finally, our approach also allows us to identify three distinct segments of Internet users—privacy guardians, information sellers, and convenience seekers."

If players are given the opportunity to be exposed to others at the expense of a small decrease in utility, players will decline this opportunity, and the original Nash equilibria of the game will survive."

In a two‐period homogeneous‐good duopoly model, it is shown that the equilibrium amount of discounts increases continuously in the expected switching costs of a typical consumer. In equilibrium, firms offer the same prices and discounts in a mature market even if they have different market shares, and the demands faced by these firms in a new market become more elastic. Firms are worse off engaging in the discriminatory pricing, while consumers need not necessarily benefit from it. There is costly equilibrium switching of consumers, which creates a dead‐weight loss to the society."

    ,"abstract":"For policymakers seeking to protect consumer data or financial stability and financial institutions that wish to keep their customers satisfied it is key to know consumers' attitudes towards payments data usage. This paper provides detailed insight into these attitudes based on unique surveys held among Dutch consumers. Privacy is considered an important payment instrument attribute, especially by low-educated, low-income, and elderly consumers and consumers who have little trust in other people or in their bank. Attitudes towards payments data usage depend on the context. For example, most people support the use of payments data to improve security or services but find sharing payments data with other companies unacceptable. Moreover, the latter practice would result in a significant decline of trust in banks. Depending on the purpose of the data use, attitudes relate to socio-demographic factors, online behaviour, satisfaction with the bank and perceptions of current data usage practices. Lastly, many consumers are unwilling to share their payments data with non-banks to use a payment app or get a financial overview. This holds especially for consumers with low trust in other people and in banks."

    ,"abstract":"Consumer information is becoming an increasingly important asset in the digital economy, allowing firms to offer targeted prices to consumers. This paper tries to shed some light on the economic trade-offs that arise when such information is obtained. We study the interplay between firms that use it for pricing purposes and consumers that want to prevent it from spreading out if they anticipate that it will be used to offer personalized and potentially higher prices. Finally, we study the emergence of data brokers, new platforms that gather and organize consumer information to sell to final market producers."

    ,"link":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/9/2/24/htm"
    ,"abstract":"Many people implicitly sell or give away their data when using online services and participating in loyalty programmes—despite growing concerns about company's use of private data. Our paper studies potential reasons and co-variates that contribute to resolving this apparent paradox, which has not been studied previously. We ask customers of a bakery delivery service for their consent to disclose their personal data to a third party in exchange for a monetary rebate on their past orders. We study the role of implicitly and explicitly stated prices and add new determinants such as political orientation, income proxies and membership in loyalty programmes to the analysis of privacy decision. We document large heterogeneity in privacy valuations, and that the offered monetary benefits have less predictive power for data-disclosure decisions than expected. However, we find significant predictors of such decisions, such as political orientation towards liberal democrats (FDP) and membership in loyalty programmes. We also find suggestive evidence that loyalty programmes are successful in disguising their 'money for data' exchange mechanism."

    ,"abstract":"We live in an age in which the dependency on technological tools is inescapable. At the same time, privacy-related issues are emerging in a way that we are at the breakpoint of losing control over our data. Information sharing by social-network, users can result in violations of privacy and security. For example, when a user is asking for a personalised service, he may find his contact details revealed, and may become the subject of harassment (cyber-bullying) or a potential victim of online deception or identity theft. Moreover, as Tim Berners-Lee stated, 'The major players are making profit from our data. Therefore we lose out on the benefits we could realise if we had direct control over this data and choose when and with whom to share it'. Today, more than ever, users need to keep control over their personal data when they ask for a personalised service. This tutorial, addresses how to reach this delicate balance between privacy and personalization. "

    ,"abstract":"We study a game in which a buyer has private valuations over a seller's product range, and can communicate these through costless messaging. The seller's preferred outcome is a fully revealing, efficient equilibrium that secures him the entire surplus whilst matching each buyer type to their preferred product. The buyer's preferred outcome is partially revealing; he releases only enough information to guarantee trade. This outcome is inefficient - almost all types purchase a sub optimal product. Such a characterization rests on a natural trade-off faced by the buyer - reveal his type in order to secure his preferred good, or hide his type in order to secure a better price. We use our results to speak directly to the debate regarding product steering versus price discrimination in online retail."

This paper characterizes equilibrium persuasion through selective disclosure of the information that senders acquire about the preferences of receivers. We derive positive and normative implications depending on: the extent of competition among senders, whether receivers make individual or collective decisions, whether firms are able to personalize prices, and whether receivers are wary of the sendersíincentives to become better informed. We find that privacy laws requiring senders to obtain consent to acquire information are beneficial when there is little or asymmetric competition among Örms or candidates, when receivers are unwary, and when firms can price discriminate. Otherwise, policy intervention has unintended negative welfare consequences."

    ,"abstract":"Recent work has demonstrated that Web search volume can 'predict the present,' meaning that it can be used to accurately track outcomes such as unemployment levels, auto and home sales, and disease prevalence in near real time. Here we show that what consumers are searching for online can also predict their collective future behavior days or even weeks in advance. Specifically we use search query volume to forecast the opening weekend box-office revenue for feature films, first-month sales of video games, and the rank of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, finding in all cases that search counts are highly predictive of future outcomes. We also find that search counts generally boost the performance of baseline models fit on other publicly available data, where the boost varies from modest to dramatic, depending on the application in question. Finally, we reexamine previous work on tracking flu trends and show that, perhaps surprisingly, the utility of search data relative to a simple autoregressive model is modest. We conclude that in the absence of other data sources, or where small improvements in predictive performance are material, search queries provide a useful guide to the near future."

Using only publicly available information, we observed a correlation between individuals' SSNs and their birth data and found that for younger cohorts the correlation allows statistical inference of private SSNs. The inferences are made possible by the public availability of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File and the widespread accessibility of personal information from multiple sources, such as data brokers or profiles on social networking sites. Our results highlight the unexpected privacy consequences of the complex interactions among multiple data sources in modern information economies and quantify privacy risks associated with information revelation in public forums."

We aim to provide a grounded-in-data, contextual smart home privacy model. The model will be applicable to product and policy design, and also inform future work in privacy research for ubiquitous computing settings."

We adapt a canonical model of second degree price discrimination a la Mussa and Rosen (1978) to a two-sided platform by focusing on non-responsiveness, a clash between the allocation the platform wants to achieve and the incentive compatible allocations. In this framework we address the key question of when a price discrimination on one side complements or substitutes a price discrimination on the other side. We offer two applications on advertising platforms and also highlight the role of commitment in eliciting personal information for targeted advertising."

Moreover, in competitive markets, the use of discounts is inversely related to the newspaper's market share.

    ,"link":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-013-9130-3"
    ,"abstract":"In previous privacy studies, consumers have reported their unease with online retailers that collect a lot of personal data. Consumers claim they will switch to alternative providers or cancel transactions if data collection is deemed excessive. Therefore, privacy appears to be a competitive factor in electronic commerce. This paper describes a study which quantifies the degree to which privacy is a competitive advantage for online retailers. In an experiment, we offered 225 participants the option to purchase one DVD from one of two online stores. Throughout the study, one online shop asked for more invasive personal data—as confirmed by an exit-questionnaire. In the test treatment, the privacy-invasive store sold DVDs for one Euro less than the other, and in the control treatment, both stores sold DVDs for the same price. Across both treatments, 74 participants made a purchase and had the DVD they bought delivered. In our study we found that, when the price of DVDs was the same between both stores, the shop asking for less personal data did not amass the entire market. When consumers were offered a trade-off between price and privacy, the vast majority of customers chose to buy from the cheaper, more privacy-invasive, firm; this firm got both a larger market share and higher revenue. The cheaper shop generated strong dissatisfaction with their privacy practises; in contrast, consumers of the more expensive store displayed only weak dissatisfaction with price. We established the validity of our analysis by checking users made informed choices, and did not select one firm over the other due to hasty decision-making or ordering effects. We found no support for either a materialistic lifestyle nor the quest for immediate gratification as to why customers chose the cheaper but privacy-unfriendly store."

    "title":"Pricing For Revenue Maximization In IoT Data Markets: An Information Design Perspective"
    ,"link":"http://weichaomao.com/src/infocom19-paper.pdf"
    ,"abstract":"Data is becoming an important kind of commercial good, while many online data marketplaces are set up to facilitate the trading of data. However, most existing data market models and the corresponding pricing mechanisms are very simple, and fail to capture the unique economic properties of data. In this paper, we first characterize the distinctive features of IoT data as a commodity, and then propose a new IoT data market model from an information design perspective. We further present a family of data pricing mechanisms for revenue maximization under different market settings. Our MSimple mechanism extracts full surplus from the market when there is only one type of buyer. When multiple types of buyers coexist, our MGeneral mechanism optimally solves the revenue maximization problem by formulating it as a polynomial size convex program. For a more practical setting where buyers have bounded rationality, we design the MPractical mechanism with a tight logarithmic competitive ratio. We evaluate our pricing mechanisms on a realworld ambient sound dataset. Evaluation results show our pricing mechanisms achieve good performance and approach the revenue upper bound. "

    ,"abstract":"5G network technologies are generally expected to empower wireless communications to enable communication for anybody; of anything and anywhere, i.e. to finally fulfil the mobility promises made since the 2G introduction in the early 1990's. A generally accepted technology vision is that new services and applications especially related to social networking, and machine-to-machine communications will be accelerated, underlining the shift to a more user centric application-driven connectivity, transparently deployed over various technologies and infrastructures by users and devices. A key challenge for realizing the vision is, however, 'How will the technology system handle user data?' For the user centric and data centric 5G technologies to be accepted and function as a viable business model, user trust in their data privacy is paramount. Today personal data have become an economic asset belonging to the service providers whose business case often includes and is dependent on the use and selling of such data. The aim of the paper is to discuss user privacy concerns in today's and tomorrow's information society with a focus on economic aspects. The paper will further discuss the ‘privacy economy' that will enable new business models focused on the economic value of private data."

We use three themes to connect insights from social and behavioral sciences: people's uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences; the context-dependence of people's concern, or lack thereof, about privacy; and the degree to which privacy concerns are malleable—manipulable by commercial and governmental interests. Organizing our discussion by these themes, we offer observations concerning the role of public policy in the protection of privacy in the information age."

Privacy concerns are thus no longer limited to government surveillance and public figures' private lives.

    ,"abstract":"If not well targeted, advertising and direct marketing inflict nuisance and inconvenience on consumers. Theoretical analyses predict that consumer actions to avoid advertising impose externalities on other consumers. We investigate the extent of such externalities in the context of the U.S. Do Not Call (DNC) registry by exploiting the exogenous timing of the enforcement of the registry. Supported by multiple robustness tests, and validation and falsification exercises, we conclude that consumer DNC registrations imposed externalities on other consumers. An increase in the first wave of registrations by 1% was associated with a 3.1% increase in subsequent registrations. This effect was stronger in larger and more educationally or racially heterogeneous markets. The externality was possibly due to unregistered consumers being more receptive to telemarketing and telemarketers increasing calls to them. Our results suggest that managers should facilitate consumer opt-out, especially in larger and more educationally or racially heterogeneous markets."

    ,"abstract":"This paper analyzes the effects of a privacy regulation that caps the level of data disclosure on investment in quality and social welfare. We develop a model in which a monopolist offers a service to consumers for free, and derives revenues from disclosing user data to third parties. Consumers choose whether to use the service and how much information to provide. We find that when the market is fully covered, a disclosure cap set prior to the firm's investment decision (an ex ante cap) always decreases quality level, but is socially desirable if quality and information are not strong complements from consumers' perspective. When the market is partially covered, quality may increase under an ex ante cap and, setting a cap may be socially desirable even when quality and information are strongly complementary. Finally, we extend our analysis to scenarios involving heterogeneous third-party data buyers, a consumer-surplus-maximizing regulator and the regulation of disclosure ex post."

    ,"abstract":"Understand that privacy is not a static concept but an interaction, in which the rights of different parties collide [pix]. A has a certain preference about the information he receives and lets out. B, on the other hand, may want to learn more about A, perhaps in order to protect herself. The controversies about caller-identification, or of AIDS disclosure by medical personnel, illustrate that privacy is an issue of control over information flows, with a much greater inherent complexity than a conventional 'consumers versus business,' or 'citizens versus the state' analyses suggests. In this case, different parties have different preferences on information and need a way to synchronize these preferences or be at tension with each other. This would suggest the need for interactive negotiation over privacy."

It replaces this view with a richer and deeper perspective on the nature of social character aimed at showing how social freedom cannot mean immunity from social pressure. The author demonstrates how our competence as rational and social agents depends on a constructive adaptation of social control mechanisms. Our facility at achieving our goals is enhanced, rather than undermined, by social control. The author then articulates sources, contracts, and degrees of legitimate social control in different social and historical settings. Drawing on a wide range of material in moral and political philosophy, law, cognitive and social psychology, anthropology, and literature, Professor Schoeman shows how the aim of moral philosophy ought to be to understand our social character, not to establish fortifications against it in the name of rationality and autonomy."

    ,"abstract":"Hon. Orrin G. Hatch United States Senate Electronic commerce will be pivotal to the United States economy in the 21 SI Century. With the advent ofelectronic commerce, some consumers have become concerned about the disclosure, transfer, and sale of information which businesses have collected about them. These concerns purportedly are slowing the rate ofexpansion ofelectronic commerce, thereby putting at risk the future growth of the New Economy. To reduce this risk, a variety of schemes have been proposed under which the government would regulate online privacy. Congress currently is in the midst ofa vigorous debate as to whether the government should regulate on-line privacy standards, and, ifso, what form such regulation should take. This succinct yet powerful book by Paul Rubin and Thomas Lenard goes to the heart of these issues. It explains that there is no evidence of actual consumer harm or market failure that could justify burdensome government regulation of online privacy. It describes the tremendous advantages consumers currently receive from the free flow of information collected on­ line, advantages which could be eliminated if the government unnecessarily regulates and stops this flow of information. It argues that the free market provides businesses with compelling incentives to adopt their own measures - such as seal programs and novel technologies - to assuage consumer privacy concerns. This book presents compelling evidence to support these and many other points central to the continuing debate in the halls of Congress and elsewhere concerningonline privacy."

    ,"link":"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/privacy-as-contextual-integrity"
    ,"abstract":"The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, 'contextual integrity,' as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of 'spheres of justice,' developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny."

Not only for assuring a better way of dealing with personal data, but including a more encompassing approach of assuring privacy. RESPECT4U offers a framework of seven privacy principles that help organisations in promoting this positive attitude towards the reconciliation of privacy and innovation: Responsible processing , Empowering data subjects, Secure data handling, Pro-active risk management, Ethical awareness, Cost-benefit assessment, Transparent data processing. This paper introduces the background of RESPECT4U, and elaborates the seven principles that form its foundation. Together they demonstrate that privacy can act as innovation driver. "

    ,"abstract":"Some economists and privacy advocates have proposed giving individuals property rights in their personal data to promote information privacy in cyberspace. A property rights approach would allow individuals to negotiate with firms about the uses to which they are willing to have personal data put and would force businesses to internalize a higher proportion of the societal costs of personal data processing. However, granting individuals property rights in personal information is unlikely to achieve information privacy goals in part because a key mechanism of property law, namely, the general policy favoring free alienability of such rights, would more likely defeat than achieve information privacy goals. Drawing upon certain concepts from the unfair competition-based law of trade secrecy, this article suggests that information privacy law needs to impose minimum standards of commercial morality on firms engaged in the processing of personal data and proposes that certain default licensing rules of trade secrecy law may be adapted to protect personal information in cyberspace."

    ,"link":"http://www.elprofesionaldelainformacion.com/contenidos/2018/ene/02.html"
    ,"abstract":"In order to personalize news, the media must collect data from the audience. Media can establish a 'datawall' for this task, which requires readers to share information to benefit from these valuable services. However, this may mean the loss of anonymity, and audience members may feel they are placing their privacy at risk. In this research, using data from the Digital news report 2016, we observe that online news audiences in Spain are worried about the privacy risks related to accessing personalized news. Their level of concern varies depending on demographic characteristics or how they access digital news. Media companies should take audience concerns into account because they do not want to lose audience trust in the process of capturing personal information for big data strategies."

    ,"abstract":"Human activities that involve the Internet lead to the disclosure of personal information, either directly, as in the case of posting photos, videos and personal thoughts on an online social network, or indirectly, as in the case of purchase preferences revealed by consumers in an internet shop. Modern systems that can store and process vast amounts of information provide boundless capabilities for using and misusing personal information. Thus, information privacy has become a prime issue of concern for users, technologists, entrepreneurs, researchers and governments. People negotiate their information privacy when they interact with enterprises and government agencies via the Internet. In this context, all relevant stakeholders take privacyrelated decisions. Individuals, either as consumers buying online products and services or citizens using e-government services, they face decisions about the use of online services, the disclosure of personal information, and the use of privacy enhancing technologies. Enterprises make decisions regarding their investments in policies and technologies for privacy protection. Governments also decide on privacy regulations, as well as on the development of e-government services that store and process citizens' personal information. Motivated by the issues and challenges above, this doctoral thesis focuses on aspects of privacy decision-making in the digital era and uses a variety of research methods to address issues of individuals' privacy behaviour and issues of strategic privacy decision-making for online service providers and e-government service providers. Based on the Cultural Theory of Risk we study citizens' intention to use e-Government services from the perspective of decision biases. In this context, we present the results of an empirical study regarding citizens' intention to use a new service offered by the Greek Ministry of Finance, the so-called 'Tax Card'. Tax Card has been used to collect information about everyday purchases and aims to diminish tax avoidance. We have examined the strong influence of Cultural Bias on the formulation of intention to use and concluded that different cultural types of people should be addressed in various ways to achieve broad adoption of egovernment services. Based on Behavioral Game Theory we introduce models of strategic interactions between users and enterprises. In this context, we study several cases. We present the strategic interactions of cloud-based online storage providers with sensitive privacy stakeholders. Privacy-related interactions are conducted between service providers and end users when the latter place their personal data in the cloud system. In this study, we use a game-theoretic model to analyse stakeholders' interactions and show how their behaviour can increase or not system reliability and also, improve or not the quality of service in a cloud computing content.  We also, present an analysis of privacy-related strategic choices of buyers and sellers in ecommerce transactions. E-commerce transactions, in addition to the exchange of goods and services for payment, often entail an indirect transaction, where personal data are exchanged for better services or lower prices. This research work analyses buyer's and seller's privacyrelated strategic choices in e-commerce transactions through game theory. We demonstrate how game theory can explain why buyers mistrust internet privacy policies and ignore privacy enhancing technologies (e.g. P3P) and sellers hesitate to invest in data protection. We propose a model of buyer-seller interaction that regards privacy policies as the basis of an agreement between a buyer and a seller, where the seller declares to follow the provisions of the policy and the buyer is expected (though not obliged) to be honest in providing information. Furthermore, we analyse the issue of trust in Cloud Services by using the case of consumer trust in Cloud Services and the role of Security Certification. As individuals and enterprises add more and more information in the cloud, security and privacy concerns are growing. Potential consumers of cloud services do not have direct access to or detailed information about the cloud service provider's infrastructure and the security measures implemented. As a result, they are not able to estimate risk, and they have to rely on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) claims. Thus, asymmetry in information available to CSPs and consumers is introduced. A way to resolve the issue of asymmetric information is to engage third-party assurance. The above study aims to examine how asymmetric information on the security system implemented by the CSP affects the strategic choices of CSPs and consumers. Moreover, we examine the role of security certification and how it may change the strategic choices of consumers and CSPs. "

    ,"abstract":"For the last few years we have been studying the diffusion of private information for users as they visit various Web sites triggering data gathering aggregation by third parties. This paper reports on our longitudinal study consisting of multiple snapshots of our examination of such diffusion over four years. We examine the various technical ways by which third-party aggregators acquire data and the depth of user-related information acquired. We study techniques for protecting privacy diffusion as well as limitations of such techniques. We introduce the concept of secondary privacy damage. Our results show increasing aggregation of user-related data by a steadily decreasing number of entities. A handful of companies are able to track users' movement across almost all of the popular Web sites. Virtually all the protection techniques have significant limitations highlighting the seriousness of the problem and the need for alternate solutions."

    ,"link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.00104"
    ,"abstract":"Government regulation of financial reporting by publicly listed firms, coupled with a punitive regime for violation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), has been in place in the United States for seven decades. Whether this regime is effective or useful is an open question, especially in the absence of data on the behavior of unregulated economies. Privacy disclosure in e‐commerce is essentially an unregulated environment with some parallels to financial disclosure. A study of privacy standards, disclosures practices, and demand for audits can help accountants and security regulators project the consequences of a competitive regime sans regulation for accounting standards, disclosure and audit practices. In this article we set up a framework for such a study, gather data from the field, and analyze privacy standards, privacy disclosure practices, and the effectiveness of opt‐out practices of 100 high‐traffic e‐commerce Web sites. We observe four diverse sets of privacy standards (TRUSTe, BBB Online, WebTrust, and PWC Privacy) competing in this market, attracting clienteles of their own as reflected in privacy policies and the disclosure of such policies. With a few exceptions, actual disclosure and opt‐out practices correspond reasonably well to stated policies in e‐commerce. There is little evidence that the prevailing competitive regime induces a race to the bottom with respect to privacy standards and disclosures. We explore the implications of these results for the consequences of a competitive regime for regulation of financial reporting."

    ,"abstract":"Dichotomies between privacy attitudes and behavior have been noted in the literature but not yet fully explained. We apply lessons from the research on behavioral economics to understand the individual decision making process with respect to privacy in electronic commerce. We show that it is unrealistic to expectindividual rationality in this context. Models of self-control problems and immediate gratification offer more realistic descriptions of the decision process and are more consistent with currently available data. In particular, we show why individuals who may genuinely want to protect their privacy might not do so because of psychological distortions well documented in the behavioral literature; we show that these distortions may affect not only 'naive' individuals but also 'sophisticated' ones; and we prove that this may occur also when individuals perceive the risks from not protecting their privacy as significant."

These novel consumer-to-consumer marketplaceshave started to obliterate the boundaries between private and economic spheres. Marketing personal assets online is inherently associated with the  disclosure  of  personal,  sometimes  intimate  information,  raising unprecedentedquestions  of  privacy.  Despite itsincreasing  relevance,  there  is  a  marked  lack  of research  on privacy  in  the  sharing  economy  literature. Leveraging  the  theoretical perspective  of  privacy  calculus,  we  address  this  gap  by  investigating  how  privacy concerns and economic prospects shape a potential provider's intentions to sharevia different communication channels. We relate privacy concerns back to an interaction of  the  provider's  channel-specific  perceptions  of her personal  connection  to  the audience as well as its size. We evaluate our research model by means of a scenario-based online survey, providing broadsupport for our reasoning."

    ,"abstract":"The median Internet user is concerned about digital advertisers collecting personal information. To address these fears, the European Union passed the Privacy Directive to regulate the common business practice of information collection. This paper investigates the potential effects of this regulation, finding that the law is likely to generate several unintended consequences. Economists and legal scholars acknowledge that personal data serves as the 'price' for accessing many digital platforms. I extend this logic to argue that if a regulation enables consumers to stop supplying this information, while continuing to consume the site's content, it is equivalent to a price control. Next, I discuss unintended consequences that this price control may generate: tie-in sales, investment flight, and altered exchange characteristics. Lastly, I conclude that, just as with traditional price controls, the privacy price control may be a way for government officials to enhance their popularity with the citizenry. In short, my analysis suggests that one of the most well-researched policy interests of economics—the theory of price controls—can shed light on one of economists' newest interests: digital privacy."

Given the movement's influence, as well as the common centrality of certain key figures, it is surprising that privacy scholarship in the United States has paid next to no attention to the movement. This inattention is unfortunate for several reasons, including that privacy law furnishes rich examples of the indeterminacy thesis — a key concept of American Legal Realism — and because the interdisciplinary efforts of privacy scholars to explore extra-legal influences on privacy law arguably further the plot of legal realism itself. The application of social science to privacy has, if anything, deepened its indeterminacy."

The seminal challenge confronting business education leaders is to respond to the ontological paradigm shift from a physical society driven by material and monetary processes, towards a digital society driven by information supply and the growing demand for information privacy. The PCT is advanced as an initial framework for engaging business curriculum planners in the considerations required to repurpose existing disciplines around digital society information and privacy processes. After a current literature review, the PCT is developed using a foundational set of information assurance principles. The PCT is business discipline specific, to catalyze incubation and further development within and across functional areas."

    ,"abstract":"Studies have repeatedly shown that users are increasingly concerned about their privacy when they go online. In response to both public interest and regulatory pressures, privacy policies have become almost ubiquitous. An estimated 77% of websites now post a privacy policy. These policies differ greatly from site to site, and often address issues that are different from those that users care about. They are in most cases the users' only source of information.This paper evaluates the usability of online privacy policies, as well as the practice of posting them. We analyze 64 current privacy policies, their accessibility, writing, content and evolution over time. We examine how well these policies meet user needs and how they can be improved. We determine that significant changes need to be made to current practice to meet regulatory and usability requirements."

    ,"abstract":"This paper quantifies the effect of state privacy regulation on the diffusion of electronic medical records (EMRs). EMRs allow medical providers to store and exchange patient information using computers rather than paper records. Hospitals may be more likely to adopt EMRs if they can reassure patients that their confidentiality is legally protected. Alternatively, privacy protection may inhibit adoption if hospitals cannot benefit from easily exchanging patient information. We find that state privacy regulation restricting hospital release of health information reduces aggregate EMR adoption by hospitals by more than 24%. We present evidence that suggests that this is due to the suppression of network externalities."

    ,"abstract":"This paper explores how state genetic privacy laws affect the diffusion of personalized medicine, using data on genetic testing for cancer risks. State genetic privacy regimes employ and combine up to three alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: Rules requiring that an individual is notified about potential privacy risks; rules restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers or insurance companies; and rules limiting redisclosure without the consent of the individual. We find empirically that approaches to genetic and health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing, but that notification deters individuals from obtaining genetic tests. We present some evidence that the latter reflects costs imposed on the supply of genetic testing by hospitals. We find no effects of state genetic antidiscrimination laws on genetic testing rates."

    ,"abstract":"This paper models how regulatory attempts to protect the privacy of consumers' data affect the competitive structure of data‐intensive industries. Our results suggest that the commonly used consent‐based approach may disproportionately benefit firms that offer a larger scope of services. Therefore, though privacy regulation imposes costs on all firms, it is small firms and new firms that are most adversely affected. We then show that this negative effect will be particularly severe for goods where the price mechanism does not mediate the effect, such as the advertising‐supported Internet."

    ,"abstract":"Advertisers use online customer data to target their marketing appeals. This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to pass laws designed to protect consumer privacy by restricting the use of data and by restricting online tracking techniques used by websites. We use the responses of 3.3 million survey takers who had been randomly exposed to 9,596 online display (banner) advertising campaigns to explore how privacy regulation in the European Union (EU) has influenced advertising effectiveness. This privacy regulation restricted advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad campaigns. We find that, on average, display advertising became far less effective at changing stated purchase intent after the EU laws were enacted, relative to display advertising in other countries. The loss in effectiveness was more pronounced for websites that had general content (such as news sites), where non-data-driven targeting is particularly hard to do. The loss of effectiveness was also more pronounced for ads with a smaller presence on the webpage and for ads that did not have additional interactive, video, or audio features."

    ,"abstract":"This paper analyzes how a privacy regulation restricting data disclosure affects quality investment by a monopoly service provider - who derives revenues solely from sharing user data with third parties - and social welfare. In our model, a user's gross utility from the service depends on its quality and the amount of information shared. We show that in a fully covered market, the regulation reduces quality investment but may still be socially desirable when quality and information are not strong complements. In a partially covered market, the regulation may raise quality and social welfare even when quality and information are highly complementary."

    "title":"Privacy Versus Antidiscrimination"
    ,"link":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20141912?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"
    ,"abstract":"This essay argues that there is often an essential conflict between information privacy protections and antidiscrimination principles. Where information privacy law or practical obscurity deprives an employer of pertinent information about a job applicant, the employer often will rely more heavily on distasteful statistical discrimination strategies. For example, the existing empirical evidence suggests that criminal background checks may benefit African American male job applicants as a whole, by permitting employers to sort among ex-cons and those lacking criminal records. In the absence of accurate criminal history information, employers concerned about keeping ex-offenders out of their workplace appear to hire too few African American males – penalizing African American males without criminal records and hiring ex-cons who are members of groups with low offending rates. The essay therefore argues that in the employment context, the government should use information policy as a supplement to traditional antidiscrimination law. More precisely, the government can publish previously private information about individuals so as to discourage decisionmakers' reliance on problematic proxies. An important implication of this insight is that there may be strong antidiscrimination rationales for Megan's Laws, more recent efforts by a handful of jurisdictions to make general criminal history information freely available on the Internet, and government subsidies for programs that make employee's prior work evaluations easily available to prospective employers. The essay further explains why in those settings where the reintegration of ex-cons into the workplace creates societal benefits, information privacy protections for criminal history status will rarely, if ever, be the most appropriate tool for achieving those benefits. The essay concludes by identifying situations in which publishing previously private information about individuals would be a poor strategy for decreasing the prevalence of discrimination. "

    ,"link":"http://www.dataprivacybook.org/home"
    ,"abstract":"Massive amounts of new data on human beings can now be accessed and analyzed. Much has been made of the many uses of such data for pragmatic purposes, including selling goods and services, winning political campaigns, and identifying possible terrorists. Yet 'big data' can also be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use new forms of data to do research that improves the lives of human beings, federal, state and local governments can use data to improve services and reduce taxpayer costs, and public organizations can use information to advocate for public causes. Much has also been made of the privacy and confidentiality issues associated with access. A survey of statisticians at the 2013 Joint Statistical Meeting found that the majority thought consumers should worry about privacy issues, and that an ethical framework should be in place to guide data scientists. Yet there are many unanswered questions. What are the ethical and legal requirements for scientists and government officials seeking to serve the public good without harming individual citizens? What are the rules of engagement?  What are the best ways to provide access while protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss? The goal of this book is to answer some of these questions. The book's authors paint an intellectual landscape that includes the legal, economic and statistical context necessary to frame the many privacy issues, including the value to the public of data access. The authors also identify core practical approaches that use new technologies to simultaneously maximize the utility of data access while minimizing information risk. As is appropriate for such a new and evolving field, each chapter also identifies important questions that require future research. The work in this book is also intended to be accessible to an audience broader than the academy. In addition to informing the public, we hope that the book will be useful to people trying to provide data access but protect confidentiality in the roles as data custodians for federal, state and local agencies, or decision makers on institutional review boards.

    ,"abstract":"Privacy is an elusive, value-laden concept, and it is hard to reach consensus on a definition.  In recent, self-serving studies, the business community seized upon this lack of clarity to distort debates about the true costs of privacy ­ costs to individuals, society and to the business community itself.  These studies have led to a mainly one-sided public discussion of privacy, overstating the costs to businesses, ignoring the costs consumers incur to protect their privacy, and understating the benefits that privacy offers to commerce and to society."

    "title":"Privacy, Disclosure, And Social Exchange Theory"
    ,"link":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5hw5w5c1"
    ,"abstract":"Maintaining the privacy of one's personal information—one's choice of when to disclose it and to whom, how one maintains control over it, and the risks of disclosure—is one of the most important social issues of the internet era. For the past decade, privacy researchers have focused on several domains, including: documenting public opinion about privacy attitudes and expectations; understanding how user interfaces affect disclosure; and focusing on understanding interpersonal privacy dynamics within social media settings, to name a few. All of this work shares the goal of furthering our collective understanding of how people think about information privacy in online settings, what they expect when disclosing their personal information, and why they make the disclosure choices they make. A common element missing from the extant privacy research is an accounting of social structures. More specifically, as researchers consider the various factors that affect personal disclosure, they often do not consider the relationship between the discloser and the recipient, and how aspects of that relationship may directly or indirectly affect one's decision to disclose. A specific form of relationship I examine here is that between individuals and the companies to whom they disclose their personal information. This dissertation explores how the structure of relationships between individuals and companies influences individuals' decisions to disclose personal information. I accomplish this though a mixed-methods approach; first, I conducted twenty exploratory qualitative interviews with ten users of the 23andMe genetic testing service and ten women who used mobile apps to track their pregnancies. I interviewed all twenty participants about their experiences using online search engines. I then conducted three online survey experiments, using a hypothetical wearable fitness device that collects personal information as the premise of the study. The experiments tested a set of hypotheses and further explored themes that emerged from the qualitative research. These studies examine the ways in which the relationship between individuals and the companies they disclose to, and in particular the distribution of power within the relationship, affects the individuals' decisions to disclose. I use social exchange theory (SET) as the theoretical framework for this inquiry because the transfer of personal information in exchange for a service is an exchange between social actors. Thus, SET provides an empirically tested scaffolding for exploring key features of these relationships and their impact on the normative aspects of exchange that affectdisclosure choices, specifically: individuals' perceptions of trust, fairness, power, and privacy. This dissertation forges new ground in the analysis of information privacy and personal disclosure. Namely, the results of my mixed-method studies demonstrate the utility of the relational analytic approach for identifying social structural factors that affect personal disclosure. Further, it demonstrates the influence of power on personal disclosure—the extent to which individuals can control the terms under which personal information is exchanged, the options available to them to obtain similar resources elsewhere, how fair the exchange is, and the extent to which individuals benefit from it. This approach yields a different set of insights into the dynamic of personal disclosure and information privacy. It reveals the impact of power differentials on personal disclosure, demonstrating that imbalances in power between individuals and companies can affect individual decisions to disclose."

    "title":"Privacy, Economics, And Price Discrimination On The Internet"
    ,"link":"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948051"
    ,"abstract":"The rapid erosion of privacy poses numerous puzzles. Why is it occurring, and why do people care about it? This paper proposes an explanation for many of these puzzles in terms of the increasing importance of price discrimination. Privacy appears to be declining largely in order to facilitate difierential pricing, which ofiers greater social and economic gains than auctions or shopping agents. The thesis of this paper is that what really motivates commercial organizations (even though they often do not realize it clearly themselves) is the growing incentive to price discriminate, coupled with the increasing ability to price discriminate. It is the same incentive that has led to the airline yield management system, with a complex and constantly changing array of prices. It is also the same incentive that led railroads to invent a variety of price and quality difierentiation schemes in the 19th century. Privacy intrusions serve to provide the information that allows sellers to determine buyers' willingness to pay. They also allow monitoring of usage, to ensure that arbitrage is not used to bypass discriminatory pricing.Economically, price discrimination is usually regarded as desirable, since it often increases the efficiency of the economy. That is why it is frequently promoted by governments, either through explicit mandates or through indirect means. On the other hand, price discrimination often arouses strong opposition from the public.There is no easy resolution to the conflict between sellers; incentives to price discriminate and buyers' resistance to such measures. The continuing tension between these two factors will have important consequences for the nature of the economy. It will also determine which technologies will be adopted widely. Governments will likely play an increasing role in controlling pricing, although their roles will continue to be ambiguous. Sellers are likely to rely to an even greater extent on techniques such as bundling that will allow them to extract more consumer surplus and also to conceal the extent of price discrimination. Micropayments and auctions are likely to play a smaller role than is often expected. In general, because of strong conflicting pressures, privacy is likely to prove an intractable problem that will be prominent on the the public agenda for the foreseeable future."

    ,"abstract":"Submitted for presentation at the first QME conference This paper explores the demand for privacy that arises from the loss of consumer surplus when firms gain the ability to treat different consumers differently. It is shown that firms in quest of a competitive advantage may have an incentive to acquire consumer information and use it to gain exclusive access to finer consumer segments, even when the costs of customized marketing are exceedingly high. When such is the case, the opportunity arises for an intermediary to coarsen market access in order to protect consumer surplus and to bar firms from exercising price discrimination. This intermediary could be a mass retailer, a mass media or a diverse community. Formally, the paper analyzes the situation of an intermediary who owns a finer market access system, i.e., the capability to separately access two types of consumers who previously remained undistinguishable. The system could be made available to one firm in exclusivity, or to several firms (two instances of 'exposure'), or to no firm at all ('privacy'). The best-bidding agent (from among firms, marginal-type consumers, and mainstream-type consumers) is buying the right to command the equilibrium access allocation. The solution involves either privacy (commanded by mainstream consumers) or exclusive exposure (commanded by a firm), depending intuitively on factors such as consumer involvement, homogeneity and adaptability, as well as the size of returns to scale in marketing and the extent of competition."

This paper addresses the challenge that big data presents to privacy. I examine what are perhaps the two most promising attempts to repel big data's attack on privacy: obfuscation and the 'propertization' of personal information. Obfuscation attempts to throw data collectors off our digital trail by confusing or misleading them. Propertization calls for treating personal information as intellectual property and would require that data holders compensate data subjects for any secondary use. I try to show that both defenses largely fail. I conclude that privacy is a lost cause and that we should call off the attempts to defend it from the moral point of view. I close with some thoughts about what this all means for libraries."

    ,"link":"https://www.darwinpricing.com/marketing/master-thesis/master-thesis-yannic-blaschke.pdf"
    ,"abstract":"Through continuous developments in computing power and profiling algorithm technology, the possibilities for online suppliers to target their price offers in accordance with consumers' willingness to pay have vastly increased. With the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, however, the processing of the personal data that is vital for the personalisation of online services becomes subject to a number of strict legal provisions. This thesis assesses the respective effects that the regulation will have on online price discrimination practices through an interdisciplinary approach. The GDPR's material scope and the rights it confers to individuals are interpreted in the light of economic theory on privacy and price discrimination and are cross-matched with insights from computer science to derive inferences on the implementation of the legislation in the context of big data analytics. Integrating the findings of this analysis under consideration of the case of the geographic pricepersonalisation company Darwin Pricing, the study concludes that the regulation will influence online price discrimination in three ways: A direct impact on its technical implementation, a behavioural empowerment impact on its technical implementation anda behavioural empowerment impact on societal welfare. In addition to an analysis of the practical implications of each type of impact, the thesis points out several of the legal, technical and ethical questions regarding online price discrimination that are left open under the new regulatory privacy framework and gives indications for further research."

    ,"abstract":"There is a long history of governmental efforts to protect personal privacy and strong debates about the merits of such policies. A central element of privacy is the ability to control the dissemination of personally identifiable data to private parties. Posner, Stigler, and others have argued that privacy comes at the expense of allocative efficiency. Others have argued that privacy issues are readily resolved by proper allocation of property rights to control information. Our principal findings challenge both views. We find: (a) privacy can be efficient even when there is no 'taste' for privacy per se, and (b) to be effective, a privacy policy may need to ban information transmission or use rather than simply assign individuals control rights to their personally identifiable data."

    "title":"Privacy, Security And Surveillance: New Insights into Preferences Of European Citizens"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2418346"
    ,"abstract":"In 2013, concerns of mass-surveillance capabilities deployed in the interest of security received unprecedented attention across the globe. Ongoing media coverage sparked public debate about the pros and cons of such capabilities. This debate is characterised by lack of robust empirical evidence on the extent to which individuals are in favour or against surveillance in the name of security. Each argument 'against' or 'in favour' of relevant security interventions and technologies is based on sources like key/expert opinions, public opinion-polls and scholarly opinion. This paper reports on insights into citizens' preferences regarding privacy, security and surveillance derived from an innovative large-scale survey. In particular, we explore the apparent dichotomy between how people respond to abstract questions about the importance of privacy and security compared to their preferences in real world contexts where individuals appear to be exhibit a greater degree of comfort with interventions that may adversely affect their privacy. Our research elaborates upon this ‘privacy paradox' through stated preference discrete choice experiments which enable respondents to express preferences over security, privacy and surveillance within real-world contexts, namely Internet use, travel on train or underground and purchase of a personal health-record storage device/system. Respondents are presented with scenarios described in terms of context dependent features relating to privacy and security implications e.g. the breadth of CCTV-camera information sharing, or the stringency of oversight regarding internet surveillance by the authorities. Systematic combinations - based on principles of experimental design of these features - create each of the options. Respondents are then asked to choose among three options presented across variations of these three different contexts with associated monetary implication. Alongside these data we gather socio-economic and demographic information and attitudinal statements relating to trust, privacy and security. Data was collected across a sample of 26,800 participants across 27 EU through a mix of face-to-face and online methods and was broadly representative of the population within each country. Choices from respondents were subjected to discrete choice analysis. This framework enables us to determine which combination of features comprising each of the alternative options drives (in terms of utility lost/gained) the choices of participants. In order to account for a range of perspectives which may colour these preferences, the analysis takes into account respondents' characteristics and their level of familiarity with each particular context, their attitudes to privacy, security and surveillance and their appetite for risk-taking behaviour in general. Analysis enables us to bring new insights into the passionate debate around privacy and surveillance. It illustrates a number of new insights, not previously explored using quantitative approaches including measurement of the extent people may balance privacy or security. We find that individuals derive markedly different utility for privacy versus security in different contexts, supporting the view that privacy and security are highly context specific. For example, all else being equal, respondents appear to prefer measures to improve online privacy compared to that derived from stand-off surveillance common in transportation. We observe that data sharing is governed by complex trust relationships. We also find that certain socio-demographic characteristics are correlated with people's preferences. Overall, preference regarding privacy, security and surveillance are context specific. For example, in some cases privacy is considered as the form of control of personal information and others as control of physical space. Our research suggests that security measures and relevant decision-making needs to be matched to different settings in order to provide the appropriate mix of protections and meaningful choice."

    ,"abstract":"Prior research shows that only a tiny percentage of users actually read the online privacy policies they implicitly agree to while using a website. Prior research also suggests that users ignore privacy policies because these policies are lengthy and, on average, require 2 years of college education to comprehend. We propose a novel technique that tackles this problem by automatically extracting summaries of online privacy policies. We use data mining models to analyze the text of privacy policies and answer 10 basic questions concerning the privacy and security of user data, what information is gathered from them, and how this information is used. In order to train the data mining models, we thoroughly study privacy policies of 400 companies (considering 10% of all listings on NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX stock markets) across industries. Our free Chrome browser extension, PrivacyCheck, utilizes the data mining models to summarize any HTML page that contains a privacy policy. PrivacyCheck stands out from currently available counterparts because it is readily applicable on any online privacy policy. Cross-validation results show that PrivacyCheck summaries are accurate 40% to 73% of the time. Over 400 independent Chrome users are currently using PrivacyCheck."

    ,"abstract":"We study the effects of privacy concerns on social network formation. Each individual decides which others to form links with. Links bring direct benefits from friendship but also lead to the sharing of information via a percolation process. Privacy concerns are modeled as a disutility that the individual suffers as a result of her private information being acquired by others. We specify conditions under which pure-strategy equilibria exist and characterize both pure-strategy and mixed-strategy equilibria. The resulting equilibrium networks feature clustered connections and homophily. Clustering emerges because if player a is friend with b and b is friend with c, then a's information is likely to be shared indirectly with c anyway, making it less costly for a to befriend c. Homophily emerges because small additional benefits of friendship within a group make linkages and thus information sharing within that group more likely, further increasing the likelihood within-group links."

    ,"abstract":"We investigate cross-country determinants of private credit, using new data on legal creditor rights and private and public credit registries in 129 countries. Both creditor protection through the legal system and information-sharing institutions are associated with higher ratios of private credit to gross domestic product, but the former is relatively more important in the richer countries. An analysis of legal reforms shows that credit rises after improvements in creditor rights and in information sharing. Creditor rights are remarkably stable over time, contrary to the hypothesis that legal rules are converging. Finally, legal origins are an important determinant of both creditor rights and information-sharing institutions. The analysis suggests that public credit registries, which are primarily a feature of French civil law countries, benefit private credit markets in developing countries."

Durch die technische, soziale und wirtschaftliche Infrastruktur digitaler Kommunikationsräume entstehen dabei neuartige Herausforderungen für den Schutz der individuellen Privatheit. Neue soziale Dynamiken sowie Datensammlungspraktiken wirtschaftlicher und staatlicher Akteure lassen die Grenzen zwischen öffentlicher und privater Kommunikation immer weiter verschwimmen. Vor diesem Hintergrund diskutiert der Beitrag Privatheit und Selbstoffenbarung als inhärente Prozesse von Kommunikation und thematisiert, inwiefern sich diese im Rahmen der Online-Kommunikation neu ausgestalten. Zunächst werden dazu die grundlegenden Theorien der Privatheit und Selbstoffenbarung erörtert. Anschließend wird Privatheit in der Online-Kommunikation aus zwei Perspektiven betrachtet: zum einen aus der horizontalen Perspektive, welche die Privatheit gegenüber gleichgestellten Mitmenschen beschreibt, zum anderen aus der vertikalen Perspektive, welche Privatheit gegenüber Institutionen und Dienstleistern umfasst. Anhand von aktuellen Forschungsergebnissen wird gezeigt, wie Internetnutzende sich angesichts dieser Privatheitsrisiken verhalten und mit den wachsenden Herausforderungen umgehen. Auf dieser Basis werden abschließend zukünftige Forschungsperspektiven entwickelt."

It outlines the standard economic critique of personal privacy. The chapter analyzes how the framework plays out for information obtained without consent and information obtained through voluntary transactions. By changing the way people behave with respect to their personal information, privacy rules generate a number of dynamic benefits. Privacy rules permit the satisfaction of private preferences. An activity that may generate embarrassment or reprobation from some sectors of society will not occur if the activity carries with it a significant risk of being disclosed. Statutory privacy legislation has generated considerable criticism from economists, it is viewed as the inefficient enemy of the common law. Much of this criticism is justified, particularly when it is leveled against mandatory nondisclosure. In the attorney-client and physician-patient transactions, a privacy default rule is the obvious choice."

    ,"link":"https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/2150/"
    ,"abstract":"Modern computing technologies and the Internet have generated the capacity to gather, manipulate, and share massive quantities of data; this capacity, in turn, has spawned a booming trade in personal information. Even as it promises new avenues for the creation of wealth, this controversial new market also raises significant concerns for individual privacy - consumers and citizens are often unaware of, or unable to evaluate, the increasingly sophisticated methods devised to collect information about them. This Article develops a model of propertized personal information that responds to these serious concerns about privacy. It begins this task with a description and an analysis of several emerging technologies that illustrate both the promise and peril of the commodification of personal data. This Article also evaluates the arguments for and against a market in personal data, and concludes that while free alienability arguments are insufficient to justify unregulated trade in personal information, concerns about market failure and the public's interest in a protected 'privacy commons' are equally insufficient to justify a ban on the trade. This Article develops the five critical elements of a model for propertized personal information that would help fashion a market that would respect individual privacy and help maintain a democratic order. These five elements are: limitations on an individual's right to alienate personal information; default rules that force disclosure of the terms of trade; a right of exit for participants in the market; the establishment of damages to deter market abuses; and institutions to police the personal information market and punish privacy violations. Finally, this Article returns to examples of technologies already employed in data trade and discusses how this proposed model would apply to them. "

    ,"abstract":"In today's world of smart phones, smart grids, and smart cars, companies are collecting, storing, and sharing more information about consumers than ever before. Although companies use this information to innovate and deliver better products and services to consumers, they should not do so at the expense of consumer privacy. With this Report, the Commission calls on companies to act now to implement best practices to protect consumers' private information. These best practices include making privacy the 'default setting' for commercial data practices and giving consumers greater control over the collection and use of their personal data through simplified choices and increased transparency. Implementing these best practices will enhance trust and stimulate commerce. "

    "title":"Protecting Consumers In Privacy And Data Security: A Perspective Of Information Economics"
    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3006172"
    ,"abstract":"This note provides an economic approach to consumer privacy and data security based on the extensive economic literature on how information flows, and is used, in the marketplace. We apply that approach to consumer protection in privacy and data security, as a step toward the ultimate goal of facilitating well-grounded cost-benefit analysis of future policy and law enforcement action in this area. Over the past two decades, the FTC has led the governmental effort to protect the integrity of consumer privacy choices in the market. This note attempts to describe the economic basis for that work in one coherent piece. Given the scope of the topic, this note is only a first step in providing clarity on the economic perspective on consumer protection in this area. We hope the note will improve future actions in privacy and data security. As a matter of scope, we do not discuss the potential implications of privacy and data security for antitrust or competition. Nor do we discuss data access and data use beyond domestic commerce. We also do not claim to provide the economics of privacy and data security. Other authors have provided the basic research and surveys that this work builds on. Other perspectives might usefully focus on how property rights in information influence the creation and flow of information through the market, or how structuring privacy as a human right would change markets and influence social welfare. Such other perspectives might also facilitate cost-benefit analyses of privacy and data security policy and enforcement. In comparison, we articulate privacy and data security issues primarily in information economic terms. In particular, we highlight the distinction between process and outcome: while an individual's privacy outcome is the realized restriction on the flow and use of information, the process that leads to that outcome depends on many parties. The decisions that each of those parties make about how that information flows, and the control that each party exercises over the flow of the individual's information, all contribute to the privacy outcome. The distinction between process and outcome is important. This is in part because while consumers may prefer more or less privacy – the outcome – given a particular situation, they all want themselves, and by extension the sellers they interact with, to have a certain amount of control over the flow. In line with other areas of market intervention, a focus on the process ensures that consumers and sellers have the tools to exercise appropriate control on the process. In turn, this should help bolster a healthy market to facilitate and honor their choice of privacy. This approach is in contrast to a more paternalistic approach that attempts to determine consumer preferences on privacy outcomes and directly impose that determination on the market. Next, we articulate how consumer-to-seller information flows are more complicated in practice than the typical seller-to-consumer information flows that typically concern the FTC in other areas, such as advertising enforcement. In particular, information flows generated by a transaction can persist over time and create effects outside of that initial transaction. These persistent effects often complicate market incentives. Because the persistence of information can cause commitment problems, and tends to exacerbate information asymmetry and externality, it is more starkly important for policy makers to foster a healthy information environment about privacy outcomes and processes, to encourage industry to develop standards and mechanisms that support a healthy information market, and to police that market if necessary. In this document, we identify some market mechanisms that have arisen to address potential market failures, and when interventions in consumer protection are most likely justified. In light of these potential market failures, we then list potential policy tools and discuss their pros and cons."

For instance, Amazon continuously tracks the behaviors of its 100 million Prime members, an example of 'first-party' data. And many companies have found that sharing their own customer information with other companies creates synergies for both parties, especially with the increasing availability of 'internet of things' data (GPS sensors, smart utility meters, fitness devices, etc.). These are examples of 'second-party' data. Finally, many companies supplement their first-party data with 'third-party' data from companies like Acxiom, which collects up to 1,500 data points on 700 million consumers worldwide."

    ,"abstract":"We model privacy as an agent's choice of action being unobservable to others. An agent derives utility from his action, the aggregate of agents' actions, and other agents' perceptions of his type. If his action is unobservable, he takes his full-information optimal action and is pooled with other types, while if observable, then he distorts it to enhance others' perceptions of him. This increases the public good, but the disutility from distortion is a social cost. When the disutility of distortion is high (low) relative to the marginal utility of the public good, a policy of privacy (publicity) is optimal. "

    ,"abstract":"News and media web pages generate valuable consumer data, collected by third-party servers. Using longitudinal experiments, this article shows that third-party servers are active in 34 cases of European public service media (PSM) websites from 19 countries. This constitutes a pressing privacy problem in relation to GDPR and challenges the notion of PSM organizations as particularly trusted providers of media content. This has implications for their role and placement in the commercial media landscape as well as for their independency, but also for their survival in the future media landscape. Our analysis shows not only connections between the presence of advertisement and the number of third-party servers found but also a reflection of different types of European media systems. To provide a benchmark for our analysis, we also analysed 64 private media websites for the presence of third-party servers. The empirical results suggest a pressing need for discussions on whether and how PSM organizations can participate in the commercial web ecology of user data exchange and utilization, for example, for the purposes of user profiling, targeting and PSM performance measurement."

    ,"abstract":"This paper is about the relationship between information and security and the effect that it has upon individual privacy and freedom. The popular conception is that security is there to 'protect' us and because of that it is welcomed by most or at worst not resisted. Security systems include those installed to protect us when travelling through to the security systems that protect our credit card transactions. The recent surveillance report suggests that the UK is the most spied upon nation in the world. So what happens to the information collected on each of us and what is it used for? This paper will explore the argument that information is a commodity increasingly controlled for the benefit of those who have power and that security, in its many forms, is an instrument to enable population control. In the paper we propose a means of assessing the optimum level of security which we argue will still provide protection without eroding our privacy and freedom. The proposal is suggested to contribute to the notion of an 'inverse' panopticon as a means of protecting privacy and freedom. "

    ,"abstract":"A long-lived consumer interacts with an infinite sequence of short-lived firms in a stationary Gaussian setting. Firms use the consumer's rating—an aggregate measure of her purchase history—to learn about the consumer's type, and thus set prices. The focus is on linear Markov equilibria when ratings discount past purchases exponentially. We find that equilibrium prices are lower in expectation than in a static benchmark due to the strategic effect of privacy concerns. The precision of the information conveyed in equilibrium by a rating is non-monotone in its persistence level. Firms may prefer more persistent ratings than under public histories, whereas high-value consumers may prefer more or less persistent ratings to uninformative ratings. Total surplus is instead maximized by uninformative ratings. Finally, hidden ratings that are not observed by the consumer reduce the sensitivity of demand and increase the firms' profits. Our analysis thus sheds light on the role that transparency and persistence of consumer data can have on market outcomes."

    ,"abstract":"The goal of this chapter is to give an overview of recent works on the development of social link-based recommender systems and to offer insights on related issues, as well as future directions for research. Among several kinds of social recommendations, this chapter focuses on recommendations, which are based on users' self-defined (i.e., explicit) social links and suggest items, rather than people of interest. The chapter starts by reviewing the needs for social link-based recommendations and studies that explain the viability of social networks as useful information sources. Following that, the core part of the chapter dissects and examines modern research on social link-based recommendations along several dimensions. It concludes with a discussion of several important issues and future directions for social link-based recommendation research."

    ,"abstract":"Criminal background checks have now become ubiquitous because of advances in information technology and growing concerns about employer liability. Also, a large number of individual criminal records have accumulated and have been computerized in state repositories and commercial databases. As a result, many ex‐offenders seeking employment could be haunted by a stale record. Recidivism probability declines with time 'clean,' so some point in time is reached when a person with a criminal record, who remained free of further contact with the criminal justice system, is of no greater risk than a counterpart of the same age—an indication of redemption from the mark of crime. Very little information exists on this measure of time until redemption and on how its value varies with the crime type and the offender's age at the time of the earlier event. Using data from a state criminal‐history repository, we estimate the declining hazard of rearrest with time clean. We first estimate a point of redemption as the time when the hazard intersects the age–crime curve, which represents the arrest risk for the general population of the same age. We also estimate another similar redemption point when the declining hazard comes 'sufficiently close' to the hazard of those who have never been arrested. We estimate both measures of redemption as a function of the age and the crime type of the earlier arrest. These findings aid in the development of guidelines for the users of background checking and in developing regulations to enhance employment opportunities for ex‐offenders."

    ,"abstract":"We investigate the conventional wisdom that competition among interested parties attempting to influence a decisionmaker by providing verifiable information elicits all relevant information. We find that, if the decisionmaker is strategically sophisticated and well informed about the relevant variables and about the preferences of the interested party or parties, competition may be unnecessary to achieve this result. If the decisionmaker is unsophisticated or not well informed, competition is not generally sufficient. If the interested parties' interests are sufficiently opposed, however, or if the decisionmaker is seeking to advance the parties' welfare, then competition can reduce or even eliminate the decisionmaker's need for prior knowledge about the relevant variables andfor strategic sophistication. In other settings onlythe combination of competition among information providers and a sophisticated skepticism is sufficient to allow effective decisionmaking. "

    ,"abstract":"Examines the role played by true uncertainty, defined as the possibility of alternative outcomes whose probabilities are not capable of measurement, in an economic system, and distinguishes uncertainty from risk. Classical economic theory teaches that perfect competition ought to drive an economy into equilibrium and eliminate opportunities for economic profit. Nevertheless, economic profit persists in the real world. The introductory sections of the book provide a historical and critical review of early attempts to reconcile theory and observation. Then, beginning with a simplified model economy of individuals as producers-and-consumers, the author derives familiar features of static economics. The model goes through further refinements of joint production, and changes with uncertainty absent with similar results. The final model is one that demonstrates how perfect competition tends to eliminate profit. The author then takes up the question of how risk and uncertainty may upset the equilibrium. Risk is the possibility of alternative outcomes whose probabilities are capable of measurement; uncertainty is the possibility of alternative outcome whose probabilities are not capable of measurement. When probabilities are known, adverse outcomes may be insured against. Uncertainty is handled by judgment, an unequally distributed ability. The successful entrepreneur is one who has the sound judgment, either in the direction of the enterprise itself or in the selection of its managers (as shareholders do). The recompense for this talent is profit. "

Our techniques are robust to perturbation in the data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversary's background knowledge. We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the world's largest online movie rental service. We demonstrate that an adversary who knows only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily identify this subscriber's record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the source of background knowledge, we successfully identified the Netflix records of known users, uncovering their apparent political preferences and other potentially sensitive information."

    ,"abstract":"We study a model in which firms offer financial products to individuals, post prices for their products, and screen consumers who apply to purchase them. Any information obtained in the screening process may be traded to another firm selling related products. We show that firms' ability to sell consumer information can lead to lower prices, higher screening intensities, and increased social welfare. By exploiting variations in the adoption of local financial-privacy ordinances in five California Bay Area counties, we are able to provide simple estimates of the effects of stricter financial-privacy laws on mortgage denial rates during 2001–2006. Consistent with the model's predictions, denial rates for both home-purchase loans and refinancing loans decreased in counties where opt-in privacy ordinances were adopted. Moreover, estimated foreclosure start rates during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 were higher in counties where the privacy ordinance was adopted."

However, a profit-maximizing monopolistic search engine imposes a distortion by charging too high an advertising fee, which may negate the benefits of targeting.

It is unilaterally profitable for a seller to deter search under mild conditions, but sellers can suffer when all do so. When a seller cannot commit to its policy, it exploits the inference that those consumers who try to buy later have no good alternative, and in many cases the outcome is as if the seller must make an exploding offer. Search deterrence results in sub-optimal matching of products to consumers and often raises the price consumers pay."

    ,"abstract":"This paper investigates whether larger quantities of historical data affect a firm's ability to maintain market share in Internet search. We study whether the length of time that search engines retained their server logs affected the apparent accuracy of subsequent searches. Our analysis exploits changes in these policies prompted by the actions of policymakers. We find little empirical evidence that reducing the length of storage of past search engine searches affected the accuracy of search. Our results suggest that the possession of historical data confers less of an advantage in market share than is sometimes supposed. Our results also suggest that limits on data retention may impose fewer costs in instances where overly long data retention leads to privacy concerns such as an individual's ``right to be forgotten.'"

    ,"abstract":"In the movie 'Life is Beautiful', Guido Orefice, the character interpreted by Roberto Benigni, convinces his son Giosuè that they have been interned in a nazi concentration camp not because they are Jews but because they are actually taking part in a long and complex game in which they, and in particular Giosuè, must perform the tasks that the guards give them. A ghastly experience is turned into a livable, at times even almost enjoyable, one. In this position paper, we advocate that, in the same spirit as Guido's ingenious trick of turning a nazi camp into a sort of playground for his child, security should be beautiful; and if it isn't so yet, it should then be made beautiful, so that the users experience it in that way. This is, of course, an extremely challenging objective, and we will discuss through further scenarios a few ways in which it could be made possible in the future. It turns out that the Peppa Pig cartoon may also be inspiring."

    ,"abstract":"In today's 'big data' Internet, users often need to assume, by default, that their every statement or action online is monitored and tracked. Users' statements and actions are routinely linked with detailed profiles built by entities ranging from commercial vendors and advertisers to state surveillance agencies to online stalkers and criminal organizations. Indeed, recent revelations have raised the stakes enormously in Internet monitoring. Documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed the U.S. government is conducting warrantless surveillance on a massive scale, and the long-term goal of the National Security Agency is to be 'able to collect virtually everything available in the digital world."

    ,"abstract":"Social Network Site (SNS) users' disclosed personal information is beneficial for marketers, as targeted advertising can be provided accordingly. This study identifies the three privacy concepts of concerns, attitudes and intentions, along with culture (i.e. Hofstede's masculinity) to be key drivers of users' self-disclosure on SNSs. Hence, this study evaluates these antecedents and their potential effect on self-disclosure, considering Facebook as the SNS of choice. To account for potential cross-cultural differences, data has been gathered via two online questionnaires, resulting in one German and one Norwegian sample of respondents. Multiple regression analyses were carried to evaluate the antecedents of self-disclosure and one-way ANOVA to examine potential differences amongst Germans and Norwegians. Results indicate that privacy intention is the strongest predictor of self-disclosure on SNSs; whereas privacy concerns and attitudes only reveal an indirect effect on self-disclosure. In addition, significant differences have been found for all of the constructs, indicating that there exist fundamental differences between Germans and Norwegians with regards to their cognitive processing behind personal information disclosure on SNSs."

The data broker can sell this data set either exclusively to one of two differentiated competing firms, or to both of them.

The first-best allocation can be achieved when data are sold non exclusively, but this never arises in equilibrium. The data broker instead sells the data set exclusively either to the high quality firm or to the low quality firm rival, according to their quality-adjusted cost differential.

    ,"link":"https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2014/programme/selling-privacy-auction/"
    ,"abstract":" Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and Cookie Matching (CM) are transforming the advertising landscape to an extremely dynamic market and make targeted advertising considerably permissive. The emergence of these technologies allows companies to exchange user data as a product and therefore raises important concerns from privacy perspectives. In this paper, we perform a privacy analysis of CM and RTB and quantify the leakage of users' browsing histories due to these mechanisms. We study this problem on a corpus of users' Web histories, and show that using these technologies, certain companies can significantly improve their tracking and profiling capabilities. We detect 41 companies serving ads via RTB and over 125 using Cookie Matching. We show that 91% of users in our dataset were affected by CM and in certain cases, 27% of users' Web browsing histories could be leaked to 3rd-party companies through RTB. We expose a design characteristic of RTB systems to observe the prices which advertisers pay for serving ads to Web users. We leverage this feature and provide important insights into these prices by analyzing different user profiles and visiting contexts. Our study shows the variation of prices according to context information including visiting site, time and user's physical location. We experimentally confirm that users with known Web browsing history are evaluated higher than new comers, that some user profiles are more valuable than others, and that users' intents, such as looking for a commercial product, are sold at higher prices than users' Web browsing histories. In addition, we show that there is a huge gap between users' perception of the value of their personal information and its actual value on the market. A recent study by Carrascal et al. showed that, on average, users evaluate the price of the disclosure of their presence on a Web site to EUR 7. We show that user's Web browsing history elements are routinely being sold off for less than $0.0005."

    ,"abstract":"This paper investigates the strategies of a data broker in selling information to one or to two competing firms that can price-discriminate consumers. The data broker can strategically choose any segment of the consumer demand (information structure) to sell to firms that implement third-degree price-discrimination. We show that the equilibrium profits of the data broker are maximized when (1) information identifies the consumers with the highest willingness to pay; (2) consumers with a low willingness to pay remain unidentified; (3) the data broker sells two symmetrical information structures. The data broker therefore strategically sells partial information on consumers in order to soften competition between firms. Extending the baseline model, we prove that these results hold under first-degree price-discrimination."

    ,"abstract":"This paper considers dynamic games in which multiple principals contract sequentially and non-cooperatively with the same agent. We first show that when contracting is private, i.e. when downstream principals observe neither the mechanisms offered upstream nor the decisions taken in these mechanisms, then all PBE outcomes can be characterized through pure-strategy profiles in which the principals offer menus of contracts and delegate to the agent the choice of the contractual terms. We then show that, in most cases of interest for applications, the characterization of the equilibrium outcomes is further facilitated by the fact that the principals can be restricted to offer incentive-compatible extended direct mechanisms in which the agent reports the endogenous payoff-relevant decisions contracted upstream in addition to his exogenous private information. Finally we show how the aforementioned results must be adjusted to accommodate alternative assumptions about the observability of upstream histories and/or the timing of contracting examined in the literature."

    ,"link":"https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/article/view/620"
    ,"abstract":"Over the past decade, social network sites have experienced dramatic growth in popularity, reaching most demographics and providing new opportunities for interaction and socialization. Through this growth, users have been challenged to manage novel privacy concerns and balance nuanced trade-offs between disclosing and withholding personal information. To date, however, no study has documented how privacy and disclosure evolved on social network sites over an extended period of time. In this manuscript we use profile data from a longitudinal panel of 5,076 Facebook users to understand how their privacy and disclosure behavior changed between 2005---the early days of the network---and 2011. Our analysis highlights three contrasting trends. First, over time Facebook users in our dataset exhibited increasingly privacy-seeking behavior, progressively decreasing the amount of personal data shared publicly with unconnected profiles in the same network. However, and second, changes implemented by Facebook near the end of the period of time under our observation arrested or in some cases inverted that trend. Third, the amount and scope of personal information that Facebook users revealed privately to other connected profiles actually increased over time---and because of that, so did disclosures to silent listeners'' on the network: Facebook itself, third-party apps, and (indirectly) advertisers. These findings highlight the tension between privacy choices as expressions of individual subjective preferences, and the role of the environment in shaping those choices."

    ,"abstract":"Using both a theoretical argumentation and an empirical investigation, this book rationalizes the view that in order to understand people's privacy perceptions and behaviors, a situational perspective needs to be adopted.To this end, the book is divided into three parts. Part I advances the theory of situational privacy and self-disclosure by discussing impacts of new information and communication technologies on traditional theories of privacy and self-disclosure. Based on five basic suppositions, it describes three major processes of the theory: pre-situational privacy regulations processes, situational privacy perception and self-disclosure processes, and post-situational evaluation processes. Next, Part II presents the application of the theory to smartphone-based communication. It first analyses how people choose certain communication environments on their smartphones, how they manipulate them, and how these external factors affect self-disclosure within these environments. It then details a multi-method study conducted to test the derived assumptions and discusses the obtained results. Part III reflects on the overall implications of the theory, summarizes the major findings and lastly considers possible extensions and perspectives on future research. Intended mainly for researchers in privacy and communication studies, the book offers privacy scholars a systematic review of both classic and contemporary theories of privacy and self-disclosure. At the same time, communication scholars benefit from an additional methodological discussion of the mobile experience sampling method, which provides an invaluable approach to measuring situational communication processes."

    ,"abstract":"In an effort to address persistent consumer privacy concerns, policy makers and the data industry seem to have found common grounds in proposals that aim at making online privacy more 'transparent.' Such self-regulatory approaches rely on, among other things, providing more and better information to users of Internet services about how their data is used. However, we illustrate in a series of experiments that even simple privacy notices do not consistently impact disclosure behavior, and may in fact be used to nudge individuals to disclose variable amounts of personal information. In a first experiment, we demonstrate that the impact of privacy notices on disclosure is sensitive to relative judgments, even when the objective risks of disclosure actually stay constant. In a second experiment, we show that the impact of privacy notices on disclosure can be muted by introducing simple misdirections that do not alter the objective risk of disclosure. These findings cast doubts on the likelihood of initiatives predicated around notices and transparency to address, by themselves, online privacy concerns."

The generated data is of significant business interest for a number of actors such as sports equipment producers, pharmaceutical firms, employers, health insurances, and many more. This topical and dynamically developing field has so far been neglected from an economic perspective. In this paper, we apply the economics of personalized data (also: economics of privacy) to the phenomenon smart fitness and derive economic effects, in particular regarding consumer welfare. Next to the theoretical and conceptual reasoning, we present a non-representative empirical study that allows for first insights into this topic and can help to identify the empirically more relevant avenues of economic theory (in regard to smart fitness). We emphasize areas in which positive welfare effects can be expected. However, we also identify areas where consumer welfare may be damaged without protective regulation. In particular cases where personalized fitness and lifestyle data are employed to individualize health insurance contributions or to inform promotion or employment decisions in companies, negative welfare aspects and negative political reactions by people must be considered."

    ,"abstract":"Automated and smart meters are devices that are able to monitor the energy consumption of electricity consumers in near real-time. They are considered key technological enablers of the smart grid, as the real-time consumption data that they can collect could enable new sophisticated billing schemes, could facilitate more efficient power distribution system operation and could give rise to a variety of value-added services. At the same time, the energy consumption data that the meters collect are sensitive consumer information; thus, privacy is a key concern and is a major inhibitor of real-time data collection in practice. In this paper, we review the different uses of metering data in the smart grid and the related privacy legislation. We then provide a structured overview, shortcomings, recommendations, and research directions of security solutions that are needed for privacy-preserving meter data delivery and management. We finally survey recent work on privacy-preserving technologies for meter data collection for the three application areas: 1) billing; 2) operations; and 3) value-added services including demand response."

The analysis uses data from a randomized field experiment that examined the effectiveness of personalizing ad text with user-posted personal information relative to generic text. The website gave users more control over their personally identifiable information in the middle of the field test. However, the website did not change how advertisers used data to target and personalize ads. Before the policy change, personalized ads did not perform particularly well. However, after this enhancement of perceived control over privacy, users were nearly twice as likely to click on personalized ads. Ads that targeted but did not use personalized text remained unchanged in effectiveness. The increase in effectiveness was larger for ads that used more unique private information to personalize their message and for target groups that were more likely to use opt-out privacy settings."

    ,"abstract":"This paper examines how teens understand privacy in highly public networked environments like Facebook and Twitter. We describe both teens' practices, their privacy strategies, and the structural conditions in which they are embedded, highlighting the ways in which privacy, as it plays out in everyday life, is related more to agency and the ability to control a social situation than particular properties of information. Finally, we discuss the implications of teens' practices and strategies, revealing the importance of social norms as a regulatory force."

    ,"abstract":"A popular buzzword these days is SoLoMo, as the contraction of Social, Local and Mobile. This refers to the convergence between social, local and mobile services and platforms. The combination of these three attributes responds to the always connected and interactive modern consumer, but also often leads to privacy concerns. Users, mobile operators, application providers and other third parties can access huge amounts of personal data for different purposes. The myriad of potential uses for personal data and the obscurity thereof increases consumers' reluctancy to fully adopt SoLoMo services. SoLoMo technology providers are challenged to balance between giving users more control over their mobile identity, but at the same time they also have to offer access to service providers and third parties to guarantee a working service and revenue. There is a need for a solution that can find a balance between privacy protection for users and the amount of information third parties need. The SoLoMIDEM project aims at developing a multilayered open SoLoMo platform, in which an optimal exploitation of big data is possible for each of its stakeholders, with the end user as primary stakeholder. For this we discuss the meaning of (location) privacy and identity in relation to privacy awareness, attitudes, capabilities and practices of users. We also elaborate on the key concepts of Location Based Services (LBS), providing a brief overview of relevant literature. In a next phase our empirical user research will deepen our understanding of the specificities of user privacy in a SoLoMo context."

    ,"abstract":"This study contributes to scientific literature by detailing the impact of specific factors on the privacy concerns of citizens living in an African city. The findings reveal that the more that impersonal data is collected by the Smart City of Cape Town, the lower the privacy concerns of the digital natives. The findings also show that the digital natives have higher privacy concerns when they express a strong need to be aware of the security measure put in place by the city. Practitioners (i.e., policy makers) should ensure that it is a legal requirement to have security measures in place to protect the privacy of the citizens while collecting data within the smart city of Cape Town. These regulations should be made public to appease any apprehensions from its citizens towards smart city implementations. Less personal data should also be collected on the citizens. Researchers should further investigate issues related to privacy concerns in the context of African developing countries. Such is the case since the population of these countries might have unique cultural and philosophical perspectives that might influence how they perceive privacy. Cities are becoming 'smarter' and in developing world context like Africa, privacy issues might not have as a strong influence as is the case in the developing world. Further qualitative studies should be conducted to better understand issues related to perceived benefits, perceived control, awareness of how data is collected, and level of privacy concerns of digital natives in developing countries."

    ,"abstract":"We study whether online platforms might reproduce offline stereotypes of girls in the STEM disciplines, and if this bias can be reduced. For this purpose, we estimate ad distribution on a popular social media platform via a field experiment by setting up a randomized online ad campaign on behalf of a French computer science school. The ad campaign targeted students in high schools in France. The treatment aims to estimate whether a message aimed at prompting girls is displayed to girls more than to boys. The article contributes to work that aims to shed light on the possible biases generated by algorithms. Our results show that on average, girls are less likely to see the ad than boys; this difference in the number of impressions is not attributable to difference in ad costs between girls and boys. The treatment ad which was aimed to be shown to more girls had a crowding-out effect, since overall, it was displayed less to both boys and girls."

    ,"abstract":"New marketing paradigms that exploit the capabilities for data collection, aggregation, and dissemination introduced by the Internet provide benefits to consumers but also pose real or perceived privacy hazards. In four experiments, we seek to understand consumer decisions to reveal or withhold information and the relationship between such decisions and objective hazards posed by information revelation. Our central thesis, and a central finding of all four experiments, is that disclosure of private information is responsive to environmental cues that bear little connection, or are even inversely related, to objective hazards. We address underlying processes and rule out alternative explanations by eliciting subjective judgments of the sensitivity of inquiries (experiment 3) and by showing that the effect of cues diminishes if privacy concern is activated at the outset of the experiment (experiment 4). This research highlights consumer vulnerabilities in navigating increasingly complex privacy issues introduced by new information technologies."

The amount of information transmitted improves the gains from trade, but also determines how this surplus will be shared between the two. Lack of commitment to a price creates a hold-up problem and a trade off between efficiency and rent extraction. In this setting, coarse information arises due to the concerns on the terms of the transaction. As the preferences get less important, information transmission becomes less precise. It is shown that in the buyer optimal equilibria of the static and dynamic games, the messages sent are just informative enough to ensure trade. In the dynamic game, the buyer is always better off sending infor- mative messages only at the first period, implying no gains from gradual revelation of information."

    ,"abstract":"Do some individuals value their privacy enough to pay a mark-up to an online service provider who protects their information better? How is this related to personalisation of services? This study analyses the monetisation of privacy. ‘Monetizing privacy' refers to a consumer's decision of disclosure or non-disclosure of personal data in relation to a purchase transaction. The main goal of this report is to enable a better understanding of the interaction of personalisation, privacy concerns and competition between online service providers. Consumers benefit from personalisation of products on the one hand, but might be locked in to services on the other. Moreover, personalisation also bears a privacy risk, i.e. that data may be compromised once disclosed to a service provider. Privacy is a human right; thinking about the economics of privacy does not change this basic fact. The authors of this report consider an economic analysis of privacy as complementary to the legal analysis as it improves our understanding of human decision-making with respect to personal data."

Through distinct channels, hiding both hinders and facilitates trade. Indeed, the social optimum involves hiding to some extent, yet not fully. Two opposing effects determine whether a consumer hides too much or too little: the first-period social gains are only partially internalized, and there is a private (socially irrelevant) second-period gain due to price differences. If time discounting is small, the second effect dominates and there is socially excessive hiding. This result is reversed if discounting is large."

This paper analyzes firms' pricing decisions and consumers' adoption of anonymizing technologies in markets where advertising slots are sold by a two-sided intermediary. In equilibrium, firms engage in price discrimination and the introduction of tracking technologies is Pareto improving for consumers.

    ,"abstract":"This study presents a signaling model of advertising for horizontally differentiated products. The central ingredients of the model are two important characteristics of advertising—targeting, and noisy information content. The theory yields interesting results about the informational role of targeted advertising, and its consequences. First, targeting can itself serve as a signal on product attributes. Second, the effectiveness of targeting depends not only on firms knowing consumer preferences, but on consumers knowing that firms know this. This creates a distinction between strategies of targeting and personalization. Third, the effectiveness of targeting in equilibrium may (far) exceed the information contained directly in the targeted message. Fourth, information content is not, however, superfluous. Specifically, when ads contain no information, a targeting equilibrium does not exist. Together, these results reveal how advertising conveys information both through the content of the message and the firm's choice of advertising medium. Furthermore, the model is robust to the various critiques of prior work on ads-as-signals: namely, that ad content is irrelevant, ad exposure is unnecessary, and the choice of ads as signals is inherently arbitrary."

    ,"abstract":"Mobile in-app advertising is growing in popularity. While these ads have excellent user-tracking properties through mobile device IDs, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. There is an ongoing debate on the value of different types of mobile targeting, the incentives of ad-networks to engage in behavioral targeting and share user-data with advertisers, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a modeling framework that consists of two components -- a machine learning module for predicting click-through rates and a stylized analytical framework for conducting data-sharing counterfactuals. Our application is to a unique data-set from the leading in-app ad-network of an Asian country. We find that the machine learning model improves targeting ability by 17.95% over no targeting. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information, and the value of contextual information is relatively small. Stricter regulations on user-tracking substantially shrink the value of behavioral targeting. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that the total surplus grows with more granular information-sharing between advertisers and ad-network. However, the ad-network's revenues are non-monotonic. Importantly, it prefers to not share behavioral information with advertisers. Thus, the ad-network has an incentive to preserve users' privacy without external regulation."

Each advertiser sells to a different segment of consumers, and each medium is targeting a different audience. We characterize the competitive equilibrium in the advertising markets and evaluate the implications of targeting. An increase in targeting leads to an increase in the total number of consumer‐product matches, and hence in the social value of advertising. Yet, targeting also increases the concentration of firms advertising in each market. Surprisingly, we then find that the equilibrium price of advertisements is first increasing, then decreasing, in the targeting capacity. We trace out the implications of targeting for competing media. We distinguish offline and online media by their targeting ability: low versus high. As consumers' relative exposure to online media increases, the revenues of offline media decrease, even though the price of advertising might increase."

    ,"abstract":"Uber and other apps for e-hailing taxis have transformed the taxi business in recent years. However, to date, U.S. regulators have not been especially innovative in responding to the emergence of Uber and the other apps. This article analyzes what taxi regulators should be doing in the age of taxi apps, for both e-hailed taxis and traditional taxis obtained by phone, by outstretched arm on the street, and at cab stands. I make three main points. First, regulators should establish regulatory standards for e-hailed and traditional taxis as a unit because they are substitutes, and in fact the same vehicle could be picking up people through street hails, phone calls, at cab stands, and by app. Second, I address the level of regulatory standards. Both traditional taxis and e-hailed taxis should be regulated to address market failures for the most part, and this means that there is a strong case for regulating traditional and e-hailed taxis less onerously than traditional taxis historically have been. Different standards might be applied to traditional and e-hailed taxis, but only if differential standards are justified based on the benefits exceeding the costs. Third, I analyze whether the incumbents in the traditional taxi industry that bear the costs of the restructuring of the taxi industry should be compensated by governments. I argue that there is no general economic case for government compensation for the incumbents, who are principally the owners of formerly valuable taxicab licenses. However, there may be a fairness argument for compensating a select number of license owners. If governments opt to compensate license owners for fairness or political reasons, they should do so through monetary compensation, not continued regulatory protections. To my knowledge, this is the first article offering a comprehensive, theoretically grounded analysis of the appropriate role for taxi regulation in the age of taxi apps, and whether incumbent operators should be compensated to cushion the effects of the advent of taxi apps. Yet how to regulate taxis, and whether to compensate traditional taxi operators for the losses they face due to the new app entrants, are now pressing issues for taxi regulators in the U.S. and around the world."

The core concept of this initiative is that by harnessing measurements of multiple modalities—not just clinical and genomic evaluations, but environmental exposures, daily activities, and many others, we can develop a much more comprehensive view of the patient's state and its trajectory over time. By understanding precisely, across all these modalities, what the distinguishing features of specific subgroups of patients are, we can better individualize therapies."

    ,"link":"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol86/iss3/8/"
    ,"abstract":"Just as a burn is an injury caused by heat, so is privacy harm a unique injury with specific boundaries and characteristics. This Essay describes privacy harm as falling into two related categories. The subjective category of privacy harm is the perception of unwanted observation. This category describes unwelcome mental states—anxiety, embarrassment, fear—that stem from the belief that one is being watched or monitored. Examples of subjective privacy harms include everything from a landlord eavesdropping on his tenants to generalized government surveillance. The objective category of privacy harm is the unanticipated or coerced use of information concerning a person against that person. These are negative, external actions justified by reference to personal information. Examples include identity theft, the leaking of classified information that reveals an undercover agent, and the use of a drunk-driving suspect's blood as evidence against him. The subjective and objective categories of privacy harm are distinct but related. Just as assault is the apprehension of battery, so is the perception of unwanted observation largely an apprehension of information-driven injury. The categories represent, respectively, the anticipation and consequence of a loss of control over personal information. This approach offers several advantages. It uncouples privacy harm from privacy violations, demonstrating that no person need commit a privacy violation for privacy harm to occur (and vice versa). It creates a 'limiting principle' capable of revealing when another value—autonomy or equality, for instance—is more directly at stake. It also creates a 'rule of recognition' that permits the identification of a privacy harm when no other harm is apparent. Finally, this approach permits the measurement and redress of privacy harm in novel ways."

Foremost among these new laws is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. The Act was introduced and signed quickly in order to prevent voters from facing a similar ballot initiative in the November election.

    ,"abstract":"This report takes as its starting point the massive accumulation of data in biomedical research and health care, and the increasing power of data science to extract value by linking and re-using that data, for example in further health or population research. It examines the scientific, policy and economic drivers to exploit these opportunities, and the concerns and potential risks associated with doing so. The faltering ability of conventional information governance measures to keep pace with these developments is identified as a significant problem. The report therefore poses and addresses the following question: 'how can we define a set of morally reasonable expectations about the use of data in any given data initiative and what conditions are required to give sufficient confidence that those expectations will be satisfied?' The report sets out a number of general recommendations, including four guiding principles for ethical design and governance of data initiatives. These help to identify specific examples of existing good practice and to make recommendations for improved practice in the use of data in the fields of health care (re-use of NHS records, clinical research, etc.) and population research (biobanks, epidemiological studies, etc.)."

    ,"abstract":"The concept of consent is a central pillar of data protection. It features prominently in research, regulation, and public debates on the subject, in spite of the wide-ranging criticisms that have been levelled against it. In this paper, I refer to this as the consent paradox. I argue that consent continues to play a central role not despite but because the criticisms of it. I analyze the debate on consent in the scholarly literature in general, and among German data protection professionals in particular, showing that it is a focus on the informed individual that keeps the concept of consent in place. Critiques of consent based on the notion of 'informedness' reinforce the centrality of consent rather than calling it into question. They allude to a market view that foregrounds individual choice. Yet, the idea of a data market obscures more fundamental objections to consent, namely the individual's dependency on data controllers' services that renders the assumption of free choice a fiction."

    ,"abstract":"New digital technologies not only support consumers in better fulfilling their own consumption needs, but also enable them to create greater value for other consumers. These new consumer co- production activities, collectively referred to as the sharing economy, require firms to rethink their role in the marketing value creation process. In particular, firms need to find new ways to create value for consumers who are also becoming producers. To address this challenge, we propose a two-layered conceptual framework of consumer co-production networks and the individual consumer production journeys therein. These concepts expand the traditional production model and consumer journey, respectively, explicitly taking into account consumer co-production activities in the value creation process. Within this framework, we draw on institutional design theory and household production theory to analyze how marketing functions can support consumers' co-production activities. We conclude with a discussion of managerial and consumer welfare implications, and of new opportunities for further research."

    ,"abstract":"Companies collect personally identifiable information that website visitors are not always comfortable sharing. One proposed remedy is to use economics rather than legislation to address privacy risks by creating a marketplace for privacy where website visitors would choose to accept or reject offers for small payments in exchange for loss of privacy. The notion of micropayments for privacy has not been realized in practice, perhaps because advertisers might be willing to pay a penny per name and IP address, yet few people would sell their contact information for only a penny. 1 In this paper we contend that the time to read privacy policies is, in and of itself, a form of payment. Instead of receiving payments to reveal information, website visitors must pay with their time to research policies in order to retain their privacy. We pose the question: if website users were to read the privacy policy for each site they visit just once a year, what would their time be worth?"

    ,"abstract":"The World Wide Web has significantly reduced the costs of obtaining information about individuals, resulting in a widespread perception by consumers that their privacy is being eroded. The conventional wisdom among the technological cognoscenti seems to be that privacy will continue to erode, until it essentially disappears. The authors use a simple economic model to explore this conventional wisdom, under the assumption that there is no government intervention and privacy is left to free-market forces. They find support for the assertion that, under those conditions, the amount of privacy will decline over time and that privacy will be increasingly expensive to maintain. The authors conclude that a market for privacy will emerge, enabling customers to purchase a certain degree of privacy, no matter how easy it becomes for companies to obtain information, but the overall amount of privacy and privacy-based customer utility will continue to erode."

    ,"abstract":"Notice and Choice' has been a mainstay of policies designed to safeguard consumer privacy. This paper investigates distortions in consumer behavior when faced with notice and choice which may limit the ability of consumers to safeguard their privacy using field experiment data from the MIT digital currency experiment. There are three findings. First, the effect small incentives have on disclosure may explain the privacy paradox: Whereas people say they care about privacy, they are willing to relinquish private data quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small navigation costs have a tangible effect on how privacy-protective consumers' choices are, often in sharp contrast with individual stated preferences about privacy. Third, the introduction of irrelevant, but reassuring information about privacy protection makes consumers less likely to avoid surveillance, regardless of their stated preferences towards privacy."

    ,"abstract":"In this paper, we address the complex relationship between big data and human rights. Because this is a vast terrain, we restrict our focus in two main ways. First, we concentrate on big data applications in scientific research, mostly health-related research. And, second, we concentrate on two human rights: the familiar right to privacy and the less well-known right to science. Our contention is that human rights interact in potentially complex ways with big data, not only constraining it, but also enabling it in various ways; and that such rights are dynamic in character, rather than fixed once and for all, changing in their implications over time in line with changes in the context we inhabit, and also as they interact among themselves in jointly responding to the opportunities and risks thrown up by a changing world. Understanding this dynamic interaction of human rights is crucial for formulating an ethic tailored to the realities—the new capabilities and risks—of the rapidly evolving digital environment."

    ,"abstract":"This study examines the economic effect of information security breaches reported in newspapers on publicly traded US corporations. We find limited evidence of an overall negative stock market reaction to public announcements of information security breaches. However, further investigation reveals that the nature of the breach affects this result. We find a highly significant negative market reaction for information security breaches involving unauthorized access to confidential data, but no significant reaction when the breach does not involve confidential information. Thus, stock market participants appear to discriminate across types of breaches when assessing their economic impact on affected firms. These findings are consistent with the argument that the economic consequences of information security breaches vary according to the nature of the underlying assets affected by the breach."

New capital goods are assumed to completely embody technical change. The assumption is made that the model will be operating in an environment of full employment although reference is made throughout to the case of capital shortage. The implications of this model on wage earners are discussed, and profits and investments are examined. The rate of return is determined by the expected rate of increase in wages, current labor costs per unit output, and the physical lifetime of the investment. Learning is an act of investment that benefits future investors. Further analysis shows that the socially optimal ratio of gross investment to output is higher than the competitive level. "

It is an international comparison of credit reporting systems in the United States and in European countries. On the theoretical level the book explains competition in information markets, especially in markets for goods made of highly personal and sensitive information. It reviews the microeconomics of information and privacy and discusses the economic incentives to disclose or to conceal information. The book also focuses on the institutions of credit reporting, the history of credit reporting agencies and the regulation of privacy and credit reporting on both sides of the Atlantic as well as internationally. Finally, on the empirical level, it reviews the microeconomic and potential macroeconomic effects of credit reporting in the credit markets of countries around the world."

    ,"abstract":"The Bitcoin digital currency depends for its correctness and stability on a combination of cryptography, distributed algorithms, and incentivedriven behavior. We examine Bitcoin as a consensus game and determine that it relies on separate consensus about the rules and about game state. An important aspect of Bitcoin's design is the mining mechanism, in which participants expend resources on solving computational puzzles in order to collect rewards. This mechanism purportedly protects Bitcoin against certain technical problems such as inconsistencies in the system's distributed log data structure. We consider the economics of Bitcoin mining, and whether the Bitcoin protocol can survive attacks, assuming that participants behave according to their incentives. We show that there is a Nash equilibrium in which all players behave consistently with Bitcoin's reference implementation, along with innitely many equilibria in which they behave otherwise. We also show how a motivated adversary might be able to disrupt the Bitcoin system and crash the currency. Finally, we argue that Bitcoin will require the emergence of governance structures, contrary to the commonly held view in the Bitcoin community that the currency is ungovernable."

The new field provides valuable insights not just into 'security' topics (such as bugs, spam, phishing, and law enforcement strategy) but into more general areas such as the design of peer-to-peer systems, the optimal balance of effort by programmers and testers, why privacy gets eroded, and the politics of digital rights management."

    ,"abstract":"Despite the rapidly growing volume and economic importance of data in the digital economy, the legal framework for data ownership, access and trade remains incompletely defined in the EU and elsewhere. De facto data ownership dominates and often leads to fragmentation or anti-commons problems in data. Combined with limited access and trade, this inhibits the realisation of the full economic benefits of non-rival data. It may slow down innovation and affect the efficiency of data markets. We examine three potential sources of data market failures: externalities related to economies of scope in data, strategic behaviour of data owners and transaction costs in data exchanges. We link the legal debate on data ownership with relevant branches of the economics literature, including intellectual property rights economics, the commons and anti-commons literature, models of trade under the Arrow Information Paradox and multi-sided markets. Economists are inclined to think that well-defined private property rights are a necessary condition for an efficient resource allocation. The question in this paper is to what extent this view holds for non-rival data. We show that the allocation of data ownership or residual control rights matters, not only for private benefits but also for social welfare. The outcomes of bargaining over data ownership and access rights do not necessarily maximize social welfare. Can regulators intervene to improve these outcomes? Would a better specification of legal ownership rights or introducing access provisions to improve efficiency and reduce data market failures? There are no easy answers to these largely empirical questions. We offer no policy solutions yet and more research is required to bring economics up to speed with these questions."

Welfare may be non-monotone in the quantity of information, hence there may be excessive incentive to collect information. This result applies to both non-productive and productive information. Over-investment is exacerbated to the extent that personal information is exploited across markets. Further, the 'free market' critique does not apply to overt and covert collection of information that directly causes harm. We then review research on property rights and challenges in determining their optimal allocation. We conclude with insights from recent empirical research and directions for future research."

We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists."

    ,"abstract":"We estimate that American firms and consumers experience costs of almost $20 billion annually due to spam. Our figure is more conservative than the $50 billion figure often cited by other authors, and we also note that the figure would be much higher if it were not for private investment in anti-spam technology by firms, which we detail further on. Based on the work of crafty computer scientists who have infiltrated and monitored spammers' activity, we estimate that spammers and spam-advertised merchants collect gross worldwide revenues on the order of $200 million per year. Thus, the 'externality ratio' of external costs to internal benefits for spam is around 100:1. In this paper, we start by describing the history of the market for spam, highlighting the strategic cat-and-mouse game between spammers and email providers. We discuss how the market structure for spamming has evolved from a diffuse network of independent spammers running their own online stores to a highly specialized industry featuring a well-organized network of merchants, spam distributors (botnets), and spammers (or 'advertisers'). We then put the spam market's externality ratio of 100 into context by comparing it to other activities with negative externalities. Lastly, we evaluate various policy proposals designed to solve the spam problem, cautioning that these proposals may err in assuming away the spammers' ability to adapt."

The debate centers on the assumption that the expansion will increase the incidence of link removal, which reinforces privacy while hampering free speech. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that the expansion of the right to be forgotten can reduce the incidence of link removal. We also show that the expansion does not necessarily enhance the welfare of individuals who request removal and that it can either improve or reduce societal welfare.

    ,"abstract":"Assessing the value of information technology (IT) security is challenging because of the difficulty of measuring the cost of security breaches. An event-study analysis, using market valuations, was used to assess the impact of security breaches on the market value of breached firms. The information-transfer effect of security breaches (i.e., their effect on the market value of firms that develop security technology) was also studied. The results show that announcing an Internet security breach is negatively associated with the market value of the announcing firm. The breached firms in the sample lost, on average, 2.1 percent of their market value within two days of the announcement—an average loss in market capitalization of $1.65 billion per breach. Firm type, firm size, and the year the breach occurred help explain the cross-sectional variations in abnormal returns produced by security breaches. The effects of security breaches are not restricted to the breached firms. The market value of security developers is positively associated with the disclosure of security breaches by other firms. The security developers in the sample realized an average abnormal return of 1.36 percent during the two-day period after the announcement—an average gain of $1.06 billion in two days. The study suggests that the cost of poor security is very high for investors."

    ,"abstract":"Although online retailers detail their privacy practices in online privacy policies, this information often remains invisible to consumers, who seldom make the effort to read and understand those policies. This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point."

    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117301853"
    ,"abstract":"We study the impact of revealing personal information on the selection of partners when forming individual networks. In our experiment, a 'contribution phase' is followed by a 'network phase': individuals first decide whether to contribute and then decide with whom to form a link. An exchange of contributions between individuals occurs only if a bilateral link is established. We identify the effect of revealing one's name on the probability of link formation by letting individuals choose to signal – at the linking stage – their willingness to later reveal their name. Our results indicate that this decision significantly affects partner selection and the consequent structure of the network. Individuals who reveal their name build up smaller individual networks but attain higher profits. Incurring privacy costs by revealing personal information is compensated with a higher probability to establish mutual links with contributors."

    ,"abstract":"We examine the effects of criminal activity and criminal conviction on the income and job stability of young British offenders. Using longitudinal data on job market performance, as well as self-reported data on criminality and official records on conviction, we estimate the separate effects of criminality and conviction. We find that criminality alone has no effect on job performance, whereas conviction increases both job instability and pay. These results confirm results we have obtained elsewhere showing that conviction increases the income of young offenders. We explain the positive effect of conviction on pay by appeal to a human capital explanation of workers' pay."

    ,"abstract":"This paper initiates the study of the testable implications of choice data in settings where agents have privacy preferences. We adapt the standard conceptualization of consumer choice theory to a situation where the consumer is aware of, and has preferences over, the information revealed by her choices. The main message of the paper is that little can be inferred about consumers' preferences once we introduce the possibility that the consumer has concerns about privacy. This holds even when consumers' privacy preferences are assumed to be monotonic and separable. This motivates the consideration of stronger assumptions and, to that end, we introduce an additive model for privacy preferences that has testable implications."

    ,"abstract":"Teeming with chatrooms, online discussion groups, and blogs, the Internet offers previously unimagined opportunities for personal expression and communication. But there's a dark side to the story. A trail of information fragments about us is forever preserved on the Internet, instantly available in a Google search. A permanent chronicle of our private lives - often of dubious reliability and sometimes totally false - will follow us wherever we go, accessible to friends, strangers, dates, employers, neighbors, relatives, and anyone else who cares to look. This engrossing book, brimming with stories of gossip, slander, and rumor on the Internet, explores the profound implications of the online collision between free speech and privacy. Solove explores how the Internet is transforming gossip, the way we shame others, and our ability to protect our own reputations. Focusing on blogs, Internet communities, cyber mobs, and other current trends, he shows that, ironically, the unconstrained flow of information on the Internet may impede opportunities for self-development and freedom. Longstanding notions of privacy need review: unless we establish a balance among privacy, free speech, and anonymity, we may discover that the freedom of the Internet makes us less free."

    ,"link":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/governance-privacy"
    ,"abstract":"Analyzes privacy policy instruments available to contemporary industrial states, from government regulations and transnational regimes to self-regulation and privacy enhancing technologies. Privacy protection, according to Colin Bennett and Charles Raab, involves politics and public policy as much as it does law and technology. Moreover, the protection of our personal information in a globalized, borderless world means that privacy-related policies are inextricably interdependent. In this updated paperback edition of The Governance of Privacy, Bennett and Raab analyze a broad range of privacy policy instruments available to contemporary advanced industrial states, from government regulations and transnational regimes to self-regulation and privacy-enhancing technologies. They consider two possible dynamics of privacy regulation—a 'race to the bottom,' with competitive deregulation by countries eager to attract global investment in information technology, versus 'a race to the top,' with the progressive establishment of global privacy standards. Bennett and Raab begin by discussing the goals of privacy protection, the liberal and individualist assumptions behind it, and the neglected relationship between privacy and social equity. They describe and evaluate different policy instruments, including the important 1995 Directive on Data Protection from the European Union, as well as the general efficacy of the 'top-down' statutory approach and self-regulatory and technological alternatives to it. They evaluate the interrelationships of these policy instruments and their position in a global framework of regulation and policy by state and non-state actors. And finally, they consider whether all of this policy activity at international, national, and corporate levels necessarily means higher levels of privacy protection."

    ,"abstract":"The influence of firms' ability to employ individualized pricing on the welfare consequences of horizontal mergers is examined in location models. In a two-to-one merger, the merger reduces consumer surplus more when firms can price discriminate based on individual preferences compared to when they cannot. However, the opposite holds true in a three-to-two merger, in which the reduction in consumer surplus is substantially lower with individualized pricing than with uniform pricing. Further, the three-to-two merger requires an even lesser marginal cost reduction to justify when an upstream data provider can make exclusive offers for its data to downstream firms."

We show that these had effects of similar magnitude.

Although the breached firms' sales and operating income did not decrease in the subsequent quarters following the breach, return on assets decreased in the third quarter. Also, performance of the control firms was higher compared to that of the treatment firms in general.

    ,"link":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2194"
    ,"abstract":"Health information exchanges (HIEs) are healthcare information technology efforts designed to foster coordination of patient care across the fragmented U.S. healthcare system. Their purpose is to improve efficiency and quality of care through enhanced sharing of patient data. Across the United States, numerous states have enacted laws that provide various forms of incentives for HIEs and address growing privacy concerns associated with the sharing of patient data. We investigate the impact on the emergence of HIEs of state laws that incentivize HIE efforts and state laws that include different types of privacy requirements for sharing healthcare data, focusing on the impact of laws that include requirements for patient consent. Although we observe that privacy regulation alone can result in a decrease in planning and operational HIEs, we also find that, when coupled with incentives, privacy regulation with requirements for patient consent can actually positively impact the development of HIE efforts. Among all states with laws creating HIE incentives, only states that combined incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational HIEs; HIEs in those states also reported decreased levels of privacy concern relative to HIEs in states with other legislative approaches. Our results contribute to the burgeoning literature on health information technology and the debate on the impact of privacy regulation on technology innovation. In particular, they show that the impact of privacy regulation on the success of information technology efforts is heterogeneous: both positive and negative effects can arise from regulation, depending on the specific attributes of privacy laws."

    ,"abstract":"This paper examines the impact of targeting technology on competition between local and general outlets. In the absence of targeting (say, of location), local outlets have an advantage in that there is a tighter match between readers and local consumers that advertisers wish to attract. Targeting restores that advantage to general outlet increasing its demand for advertising but also allows it to more efficiently allocate scarce advertising space. In a baseline case, we demonstrate that such space is the critical constraint and if it can be easily expanded then the adoption of targeting has no impact on profits or competition. We then analyze three extensions of the model in which targeting does benefit general outlets: advertising space is limited or costly; there is heterogeneity across local media markets; or advertisers are capacity-constrained (creating competition between outlets on the advertising-side of the industry). Even in these cases, however, the impact of targeting is mitigated by the fact that when targeting is introduced, it is optimal for outlets to cut back on their supply of ad space."

    "title":"The Impact Of The Internet On Advertising Markets For News Media"
    ,"link":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w19419"
    ,"abstract":"In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that an important force behind the collapse in advertising revenue experienced by newspapers over the past decade is the greater consumer switching facilitated by online consumption of news. We introduce a model of the market for advertising on news media outlets whereby news outlets are modeled as competing two-sided platforms bringing together heterogeneous, partially multi-homing consumers with advertisers with heterogeneous valuations for reaching consumers. A key feature of our model is that the multi-homing behavior of the advertisers is determined endogenously. The presence of switching consumers means that, in the absence of perfect technologies for tracking the ads seen by consumers, advertisers purchase wasted impressions: they reach the same consumer too many times. This has subtle effects on the equilibrium outcomes in the advertising market. One consequence is that multi-homing on the part of advertisers is heterogeneous: high-value advertisers multi-home, while low- value advertisers single-home. We characterize the impact of greater consumer switching on outlet profits as well as the impact of technologies that track consumers both within and across outlets on those profits. Somewhat surprisingly, superior tracking technologies may not always increase outlet profits, even when they increase efficiency. In extensions to the baseline model, we show that when outlets that show few or ineffective ads (e.g. blogs) attract readers from traditional outlets, the losses are at least partially offset by an increase in ad prices. Introducing a paywall does not just diminish readership, but it furthermore reduce advertising prices (and leads to increases in advertising prices on competing outlets)."

    "title":"The Implications Of Privacy-Aware Choice"
    ,"link":"https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10104/"
    ,"abstract":"Privacy concerns are becoming a major obstacle to using data in the way that we want. It's often unclear how current regulations should translate into technology, and the changing legal landscape surrounding privacy can cause valuable data to go unused. In addition, when people know that their current choices may have future consequences, they might modify their behavior to ensure that their data reveal less---or perhaps, more favorable---information about themselves. Given these concerns, how can we continue to make use of potentially sensitive data, while providing satisfactory privacy guarantees to the people whose data we are using? Answering this question requires an understanding of how people reason about their privacy and how privacy concerns affect behavior. In this thesis, we study how strategic and human aspects of privacy interact with existing tools for data collection and analysis. We begin by adapting the standard model of consumer choice theory to a setting where consumers are aware of, and have preferences over, the information revealed by their choices. In this model of privacy-aware choice, we show that little can be inferred about a consumer's preferences once we introduce the possibility that she has concerns about privacy, even when her preferences are assumed to satisfy relatively strong structural properties. Next, we analyze how privacy technologies affect behavior in a simple economic model of data-driven decision making. Intuition suggests that strengthening privacy protections will both increase utility for the individuals providing data and decrease usefulness of the computation. However, we demonstrate that this intuition can fail when strategic concerns affect consumer behavior. Finally, we study the problem an analyst faces when purchasing and aggregating data from strategic individuals with complex incentives and privacy concerns. For this problem, we provide both mechanisms for eliciting data that satisfy the necessary desiderata, and impossibility results showing the limitations of privacy-preserving data collection."

    ,"link":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/466995?journalCode=jle"
    ,"abstract":"We have analyzed the question of whether a monopolist can mislead consumers about his quality. Our basic principle can be described as follows: Consider the best contract that the monopolist could offer in a world where the consumers know the monopolist's quality ('the knownquality contract'). This contract extracts all the consumer surplus from the consumer and makes the monopolist as much profit as he can get. Consumers are left indifferent between buying and not buying the item. In a world where there is incomplete information, a monopolist with low quality has the potential of doing even better. If he can mislead consumers into thinking he is of high quality, then he can make the consumers worse off from buying his product instead of their next best alternative. In Section 3 we showed that this is impossible if consumers can make 'rational inferences.' If the 'known-quality' contract does not depend on the monopolist's quality (as it does not when it involves a complete warranty), then the consumer knows that anything which makes the monopolist better off than the full information contract must make him worse off, so he does not purchase anything else.

    ,"link":"https://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/18814.short"
    ,"abstract":"The racial segregation of romantic networks has been documented by social scientists for generations. However, because of limitations in available data, we still have a surprisingly basic idea of the extent to which this pattern is generated by actual interpersonal prejudice as opposed to structural constraints on meeting opportunities, how severe this prejudice is, and the circumstances under which it can be reduced. I analyzed a network of messages sent and received among 126,134 users of a popular online dating site over a 2.5-mo period. As in face-to-face interaction, online exchanges are structured heavily by race. Even when controlling for regional differences in meeting opportunities, site users—especially minority site users—disproportionately message other users from the same racial background. However, this high degree of self-segregation peaks at the first stage of contact. First, users from all racial backgrounds are equally likely or more likely to cross a racial boundary when reciprocating than when initiating romantic interest. Second, users who receive a cross-race message initiate more new interracial exchanges in the future than they would have otherwise. This effect varies by gender, racial background, and site experience; is specific to the racial background of the original sender; requires that the recipient replied to the original message; and diminishes after a week. In contrast to prior research on relationship outcomes, these findings shed light on the complex interactional dynamics that—under certain circumstances—may amplify the effects of racial boundary crossing and foster greater interracial mixing."

    ,"link":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431?origin=JSTOR-pdf&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"
    ,"abstract":"This paper relates quality and uncertainty. The existence of goods of many grades poses interesting and important problems for the theory of markets. On the one hand, the interaction of quality differences and uncertainty may explain important institutions of the labor market. On the other hand, this paper presents a struggling attempt to give structure to the statement: 'Business in underdeveloped countries is difficult'; in particular, a structure is given for determining the economic costs of dishonesty. Additional applications of the theory include comments on the structure of money markets, on the notion of 'insurability,' on the liquidity of durables, and on brand-name goods.There are many markets in which buyers use some market statistic to judge the quality of prospective purchases. In this case there is incentive for sellers to market poor quality merchandise, since the returns for good quality accrue mainly to the entire group whose statistic is affected rather than to the individual seller. As a result there tends to be a reduction in the average quality of goods and also in the size of the market. It should also be perceived that in these markets social and private returns differ, and therefore, in some cases, governmental intervention may increase the welfare of all parties. Or private institutions may arise to take advantage of the potential increases in welfare which can accrue to all parties. By nature, however, these institutions are nonatomistic, and therefore concentrations of power - with ill consequences of their own - can develop. The automobile market is used as a finger exercise to illustrate and develop these thoughts. It should be emphasized that this market is chosen for its concreteness and ease in understanding rather than for its importance or realism. "

    ,"abstract":"The FTC has been in the privacy game for almost twenty years. In that time span, the digital economy has exploded, dramatically increasing the importance of privacy regulation to the economy. Unfortunately, the sophistication of the FTC's privacy policy has yet to keep pace with its stature. Privacy stands today where antitrust stood in the 1970s. Antitrust's embrace of economics helped transform it into a coherent body of law that almost all agree has been a boon for consumers. Privacy regulation at the FTC is ripe for a similar revolution. We examine the history of FTC privacy enforcement and policy making, with special attention paid to the lack of economic analysis, and we show the unique ability of economic analysis to ferret out conduct that is likely to threaten consumer welfare, and provide a framework for FTC privacy analysis going forward. Specifically, the FTC needs to be more precise in identifying privacy harms and to develop an empirical footing for both its enforcement posture and prophylactic measures that it urges firms to adopt, such as 'privacy by design' and 'data minimization.' The sooner that the FTC begins to incorporate serious economic analysis and rigorous empirical evidence into its privacy policy, the sooner consumers will begin to reap the rewards."

    ,"abstract":"Online advertising accounts for almost 9 percent of all advertising in the United States. This share is expected to increase as more media is consumed over the Internet and as more advertisers shift spending to online technologies. The expansion of Internet-based advertising is transforming the advertising business by providing more efficient methods of matching advertisers and consumers and transforming the media business by providing a source of revenue for online media firms that competes with traditional media firms. The precipitous decline of the newspaper industry is one manifestation of the symbiotic relationship between online content and advertising. Online-advertising is provided by a series of interlocking multisided platforms that facilitate the matching of advertisers and consumers. These intermediaries increasingly make use of detailed individual data, predictive methods, and matching algorithms to create more efficient matches between consumers and advertisers. Some of their methods raise public policy issues that require balancing benefits from providing consumers more valuable advertising against the possible loss of valuable privacy."

    ,"abstract":"Behavior-based personalization' has gained popularity in recent years, whereby businesses offer personalized products based on consumers' purchase histories. This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based personalization in competitive markets. First, although purchase histories reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such information damages differentiation, similar to the classic finding that behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the information value of purchase histories. Ideally, if a market leader serves all consumers on day 1, purchase histories contain no information about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are willing to accommodate a market leader, firms are more likely to offer a mainstream design at day 1, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs."

Though legislators allegedly craft digital privacy regulation to protect consumers, some advocates have understated the dangers that digital privacy law may engender.

The regulatory process fails to simulate the market process, stifles entrepreneurial discovery, and creates opportunities for superfluous discovery.

    ,"abstract":"The cloud computing market has exhibited phenomenal economic growth. However the Snowden revelations of NSA spying degraded the privacy reputation of US cloud service providers. We examine the economic impact of this effect by using a panel dataset of cloud revenues across; service types, vendors, and countries. We assume that the US based providers were 'treated' by NSA spying as a negative quality shock, and the non-US firms are the control group. We find that the Snowden revelations decreased the growth of revenues of US providers by 11%. Consistent with the Green-Porter and APS models we find that after the negative shock a price war occurs resulting in 65% cut in prices in one week. Thus even though US firms lose revenue, after the impulse effect they capture greater market share due to the price war."

Plato, in his work The Republic, proposed an ideal system of government that should cause any lover of liberty and progress to recoil. Popper warned that in Plato's utopia, 'Everything possible has been done to eradicate from our life everywhere and in every way all that is private and individual…. Our very eyes and ears and hands seem to see, to hear, and to act, as if they belonged not to individuals but to the community.'"

    ,"link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00070.x"
    ,"abstract":"Impelled by the development of technologies that facilitate collection, distribution, storage, and manipulation of personal consumer information, privacy has become a 'hot' topic for policy makers. Commercial interests seek to maximize and then leverage the value of consumer information, while, at the same time, consumers voice concerns that their rights and ability to control their personal information in the marketplace are being violated. However, despite the complaints, it appears that consumers freely provide personal data. This research explores what we call the 'privacy paradox' or the relationship between individuals' intentions to disclose personal information and their actual personal information disclosure behaviors."

    ,"abstract":"This paper is concerned with those actions of business firms which have harmful effects on others. The standard example is that of a factory the smoke from which has harmful effects on those occupying neighbouring properties. The economic analysis of such a situation has usually proceeded in terms of a divergence between the private and social product of the factory, in which economists have largely followed the treatment of Pigou in The Economics of Welfare. The conclusions to which this kind of analysis seems to have led most economists is that it would be desirable to make the owner of the factory liable for the damage caused to those injured by the smoke, or alternatively, to place a tax on the factory owner varying with the amount of smoke produced and equivalent in money terms to the damage it would cause, or finally, to exclude the factory from residential districts (and presumably from other areas in which the emission of smoke would have harmful effects on others). It is my contention that the suggested courses of action are inappropriate, in that they lead to results which are not necessarily, or even usually, desirable."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874202"
    ,"abstract":"We investigate the decision of experimental subjects to incur the risk of revealing personal private information to other participants. We do so by using a novel method to generate personal information that reliably induces privacy concerns in the laboratory. We show that individual decisions to incur privacy risk are correlated with decisions to incur monetary risk. We find that partially depriving subjects of control over the revelation of their personal information does not lead them to lose interest in protecting it. We also find that making subjects think of privacy decisions after financial decisions reduces their aversion to privacy risk. Finally, surveyed attitude to privacy and explicit willingness to pay or to accept payment for personal information correlate well with willingness to incur privacy risk. Having shown that privacy loss can be assimilated to a monetary loss, we compare decisions to incur risk in privacy lotteries with risk attitude in monetary lotteries to derive estimates of the implicit monetary value of privacy. The average implicit monetary value of privacy is about equal to the average willingness to pay to protect private information, but the two measures do not correlate at the individual level. We conclude by underlining the need to know individual attitudes to risk to properly evaluate individual attitudes to privacy as such."

    ,"abstract":"This Article is the text of the John A. Sibley Lecture delivered on March 2, 1978, at the University of Georgia School of Law, and is part of a collaborative project with George J. Stigler on the law and economics of privacy. The present Article attempts an economic analysis of the dissemination and withholding of information primarily in personal rather than business contexts. It is thus concerned with such matters as prying, eavesdropping, 'self-advertising,' and gossip. The line between personal and commercial is not always clear or useful, and I shall not maintain it unwaveringly; the emphasis, however, is on the personal. The first part of the Article develops the economic analysis. I remark in passing the irony that personal privacy seems to be valued more highly than organizational privacy, judging by current public policy trends, although a reverse ordering would be more consistent with the economics of the problem. The second part of the Article examines the principles of tort law that protect a 'right of privacy' in both commercial and personal contexts (the former is discussed only briefly, however) and concludes that the judges in tort cases have been sensitive to the economics of privacy."

    ,"abstract":"At the end of January, the European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights, and Citizenship, Viviane Reding, announced the European Commission's proposal to create a sweeping new privacy right—the 'right to be forgotten.' The right, which has been hotly debated in Europe for the past few years, has finally been codified as part of a broad new proposed data protection regulation. Although Reding depicted the new right as a modest expansion of existing data privacy rights, in fact it represents the biggest threat to free speech on the Internet in the coming decade. The right to be forgotten could make Facebook and Google, for example, liable for up to two percent of their global income if they fail to remove photos that people post about themselves and later regret, even if the photos have been widely distributed already. Unless the right is defined more precisely when it is promulgated over the next year or so, it could precipitate a dramatic clash between European and American conceptions of the proper balance between privacy and free speech, leading to a far less open Internet.

We provide evidence of significant frictions in how employees search for and share salary information and suggestive evidence that these frictions are due to privacy norms.

A common issue raised within the literature is the individual and societal trade-off that arises with sharing and protecting personal health data. In order for individuals to be willing to give up some amount of privacy and control over their data, they ultimately need to decide if the benefits outweigh the costs.

Probably best known is the so-called delivery drone that many companies are testing and hoping to deploy. But the acceptance of said technology, especially those equipped with cameras, by the public is rarely investigated. Therefore, an empirical survey (N = 228) was conducted in Germany to determine the influence of expertise with aviation as well as privacy disposition on the perception of multicopters. It was found that a regular pilot's license did not impact the attitude towards drones from people with no experience with aviation, drones or otherwise. Concerning drones flying over the own home, not even active drone users would condone a stranger's multicopter to cross over their property unless operated by rescue services. Here the important factor is the need for privacy and perceived risk of it being violated."

    ,"abstract":"We consider the problems of societal norms for cooperation and reputation when it is possible to obtain cheap pseudonyms, something that is becoming quite common in a wide variety of interactions on the Internet. This introduces opportunities to misbehave without paying reputational consequences. A large degree of cooperation can still emerge, through a convention in which newcomers 'pay their dues' by accepting poor treatment from players who have established positive reputations. One might hope for an open society where newcomers are treated well, but there is an inherent social cost in making the spread of reputations optional. We prove that no equilibrium can sustain significantly more cooperation than the dues‐paying equilibrium in a repeated random matching game with a large number of players in which players have finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there is a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes. Although one could remove the inefficiency of mistreating newcomers by disallowing anonymity, this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of transactions. We discuss the use of entry fees, which permits newcomers to be trusted but excludes some players with low payoffs, thus introducing a different inefficiency. We also discuss the use of free but unreplaceable pseudonyms, and describe a mechanism that implements them using standard encryption techniques, which could be practically implemented in electronic transactions."

    ,"abstract":"New Annenberg survey results indicate that marketers are misrepresenting a large majority of Americans by claiming that Americans give out information about themselves as a tradeoff for benefits they receive. To the contrary, the survey reveals most Americans do not believe that ‘data for discounts' is a square deal. The findings also suggest, in contrast to other academics' claims, that Americans' willingness to provide personal information to marketers cannot be explained by the public's poor knowledge of the ins and outs of digital commerce.Our findings, instead, support a new explanation: a majority of Americans are resigned to giving up their data — and that is why many appear to be engaging in tradeoffs. Resignation occurs when a person believes an ndesirable outcome is inevitable and feels powerless to stop it. Rather than feeling able to make choices, Americans believe it is futile to manage what companies can learn about them. Our study reveals that more than half do not want to lose control over their information but also believe this loss of control has already happened. By misrepresenting the American people and championing the tradeoff argument, marketers give policymakers false justifications for allowing the collection and use of all kinds of consumer data often in ways that the public find objectionable. Moreover, the futility we found, combined with a broad public fear about what companies can do with the data, portends serious difficulties not just for individuals but also — over time — for the institution of consumer commerce."

    ,"link":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809376"
    ,"abstract":"Hayek proposes that the problem of a rational economic order is how to secure the best use of resources known to any member of society for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Contributing to the difficulties in solving the problem is that no person ever has all the available knowledge that exists when making an economic choice; in reality knowledge is dispersed among all people. Solution of economic problems is made by persons with practical, specialized knowledge of circumstances of time and place. How knowledge on which people base their plans is communicated to people is a crucial problem for explaining economic process. Economic problems cannot be solved by central planning, which cannot take into account all the circumstances of time and place, especially when society must rapidly adapt to change. Only decentralization can ensure that knowledge of particular circumstances will be used by those familiar with the circumstances. Providing information is the true value of the price system, for it is the means of communicating information to those making economic choices so that their choices fit into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system; it is a system for registering change. Prices act to coordinate the separate actions of different people. Hayek argues that methodologies (such as those of equilibrium analysis and Joseph Schumpeter) that assume people's knowledge corresponds with the object facts of a situation (i.e., that people act upon full information) are faulty.

    ,"link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217304910"
    ,"abstract":"This study examines the impact of privacy defaults and expert recommendations on smartphone users' willingness to pay for 'privacy-enhanced' features on paid applications using a 2 (privacy premium default/no privacy premium default) x 2 (privacy expert recommendation/non-privacy expert recommendation) experimental design. Participants (N = 309) configured four paid apps with respect to privacy features. Selecting premium privacy features was associated with an increased cost, while removing premium privacy features reduced the cost of the application. Replicating findings from behavioral economics on default modes in decision-making, we found that participants presented with apps with privacy premium default features were more likely to retain the more expensive privacy features. However, the recommendation source did not have a significant effect on this relationship. We discuss how these findings extend existing work on users' decision-making process around privacy and suggest potential avenues for nudging users' privacy behaviors on mobile devices."

    ,"abstract":"In this paper we propose a model where personal data collected on consumers online have multidimensional characteristics and are used by platforms to offer ad slots with better targeting possibilities to a market of differentiated advertisers through real-time auctions. A platform controls the amount of information about consumers that it discloses to advertisers, thereby affecting the dispersion of advertisers' valuations for the slot. We first show by way of simulations that the amount of consumer-specific information that is optimally revealed to advertisers increases with the degree of competition on the advertising market and decreases with the cost of information disclosure for a monopolistic platform, competing platforms or a welfare-maximizing platform, provided the advertising market is not highly concentrated. Second, we exhibit different properties between the welfare-maximizing situation and the imperfectly competitive market situations with respect to how the incremental value of information varies: there are decreasing social returns to consumers' data while private returns may be increasing or decreasing locally."

    ,"abstract":"We estimate the value of online privacy with a differentiated products model of the demand for Smartphone apps. We study the apps market because it is typically necessary for the consumer to relinquish some personal information through 'privacy permissions' to obtain the app and its benefits. Results show that the representative consumer is willing to make a one-time payment for each app of $2.28 to conceal their browser history, $4.05 to conceal their list of contacts, $1.19 to conceal their location, $1.75 to conceal their phone's identification number, and $3.58 to conceal the contents of their text messages. The consumer is also willing to pay $2.12 to eliminate advertising. Valuations for concealing contact lists and text messages for 'more experienced' consumers are also larger than those for 'less experienced' consumers. Given the typical app in the marketplace has advertising, requires the consumer to reveal their location and their phone's identification number, the benefit from consuming this app must be at least $5.06."

    ,"abstract":"This paper investigates the effects of price discrimination on prices, profits and consumer surplus, when one or more competing firms can use consumers' private information to price discriminate and consumers can pay a privacy cost to avoid it. While a monopolist always benefits from higher privacy costs, this is not true in the competing duopoly case. In this last case, firms' individual profits are decreasing while consumer surplus is increasing in the privacy cost. Finally, under competition, we show that the optimal selling strategy for the owner of consumer data consists in dealing exclusively with one firm in order to create maximal competition between the winner and the loser of data. This brings inefficiencies, and we show that policy makers should concentrate their attention on exclusivity deals rather than making it easier for consumers to protect their privacy."

    ,"abstract":"We investigate the effects of price discrimination on prices, profits, and consumer surplus when (a) at least one competing firm can use consumers' private information to price discriminate yet (b) consumers can prevent such use by paying a 'privacy cost.' Unlike a monopolist, competing duopolists do not always benefit from a higher privacy cost because each firm's profit decreases—and consumer surplus increases—with that cost. Under such competition, the optimal strategy for an owner of consumer data that sells information in a single block is selling to only one firm, thereby maximizing the stakes for rival buyers. The resulting inefficiencies imply that policy makers should devote more attention to discouraging exclusivity deals and less to ensuring that consumers can easily protect their privacy."

    ,"abstract":"We analyze how alternative consumer data handling regimes affect the welfare of consumers, advertising firms, and an intermediary Ad exchange in the context of targeted advertising. We find that the collection and use of consumer data for targeting purposes affect consumer welfare through three distinct, and possibly countervailing, effects: match improvement, offer discrimination, and supply expansion. Furthermore, we find that the economic interests of the three agents can be misaligned, depending on the degree of heterogeneity in consumer preferences. Finally, we find that a strategic intermediary may choose to share with advertising firms only a subset of consumer data, maximizing its profits at their cost. In situations where the intermediary has an incentive to reveal the information that maximizes its payoff, overlooking the other agents' interests, regulation of data collection and sharing may increase consumers' welfare."

    ,"abstract":"Third party tracking allows companies to identify users and track their behaviour across multiple digital services. This paper presents an empirical study of the prevalence of third-party trackers on 959,000 apps from the US and UK Google Play stores. We find that most apps contain third party tracking, and the distribution of trackers is long-tailed with several highly dominant trackers accounting for a large portion of the coverage. The extent of tracking also differs between categories of apps; in particular, news apps and apps targeted at children appear to be amongst the worst in terms of the number of third party trackers associated with them. Third party tracking is also revealed to be a highly trans-national phenomenon, with many trackers operating in jurisdictions outside the EU. Based on these findings, we draw out some significant legal compliance challenges facing the tracking industry."

Webpages are increasingly composed of content from myriad unrelated 'third-party' websites in the business of advertising, analytics, social networking, and more. Third-party services have tremendous value: they support free content and facilitate web innovation. But third-party services come at a privacy cost: researchers, civil society organizations, and policymakers have increasingly called attention to how third parties can track a user's browsing activities across websites. This paper surveys the current policy debate surrounding third-party web tracking and explains the relevant technology. It also presents the FourthParty web measurement platform and studies we have conducted with it. Our aim is to inform researchers with essential background and tools for contributing to public understanding and policy debates about web tracking."

Building on previous research we propose that three structures—technical, legal, and commercial—make up the base for how three facets—factual, social, and physical—of online anonymity can be realised in interactions online. Indeed, we argue that plurality of the concept, anonymities, instead of anonymity might be key in moving research on the matter forward. We present a model where our structures and facets together to build up the phenomenon of online anonymities, which can be seen as processes across time guided by regulations on both a legal and commercial scale as well as the technological structure, which relies heavily on perceptions and interpretations of being anonymous along factual, social, and physical lines. In the end we analyse three empirical examples based on our own research, where we attempt to show how the model can be useful in empirical research."

    ,"abstract":"The word Crowdsourcing IS a compound contraction of Crowd and Outsourcing, was used by Howe in order to define outsourcing to the crowd. Beyond cost, benefits for the company can be substantial. It can externalize the risk of failure and it only pays for products or services that meet its expectations. The Crowdsourcing phenomenon covers heterogeneous situations and it has inspired a number of authors. However, we are still lacking a general and synthetic view of this concept. The aim of our work is to characterize Crowdsourcing in its various aspects. First we define of Crowdsourcing, and provide examples that illustrate the diversity of Crowdsourcing practices and we present similarities and differences between Crowdsourcing and established theories (Open Innovation, User Innovation and Open Source Software). Then, we propose and illustrate a typology of Crowdsourcing practices based on two criteria: the integrative or selective nature of the process and the type of tasks that are crowd sourced (simple, complex and creative tasks). In either case, the client firm seeks to mobilize external competencies. Relying upon the crowd can be an adequate method, because of its unique characteristics that are fostered by the Internet. Finally, we present some potential benefits and pitfalls of Crowdsourcing."

    ,"abstract":"Over the last decades, people's behaviour and attitudes towards privacy have been thoroughly studied by scholars, approaching the issue from different perspectives. To address privacy-related decisions, it is necessary to consider aspects of human cognition, employing, for instance, methods used in Human-Computer Interaction and Information Science research. This paper analyses findings and contributions of existing privacy decision-making research, and suggests filling gaps in current understanding by applying a cognitive architecture framework to model privacy decision-making. This may broaden the range of factors and their relationships that can be integrated into the models of privacy decisions, beyond those in existing decision models."

    ,"abstract":"Telemonitoring devices can be used to screen consumers' characteristics and mitigate information asymmetries that lead to adverse selection in insurance markets. However, some consumers value their privacy and dislike sharing private information with insurers. In the second-best efficient Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence framework, we allow for consumers to reveal their risk type for an individual subjective cost and show analytically how this affects insurance market equilibria as well as utilitarian social welfare. Our analysis shows that the choice of information disclosure with respect to revelation of their risk type can substitute deductibles for consumers whose transparency aversion is sufficiently low. This can lead to a Pareto improvement of social welfare and a Pareto efficient market allocation. However, if all consumers are offered cross-subsidizing contracts, the introduction of a transparency contract decreases or even eliminates cross-subsidies. Given the prior existence of a WMS equilibrium, utility is shifted from individuals who do not reveal their private information to those who choose to reveal. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the discussion on consumer protection in the context of digitalization. It shows that new technologies bring new ways to challenge crosssubsidization in insurance markets and stresses the negative externalities that digitalization has on consumers who are not willing to take part in this development."

    ,"abstract":"The problem of theorizing privacy moves on two levels, the first consisting of an inadequate conceptual vocabulary and the second consisting of an inadequate institutional grammar. Privacy rights are supposed to protect individual subjects, and so conventional ways of understanding privacy are subject-centered, but subject-centered approaches to theorizing privacy also wrestle with deeply embedded contradictions. And privacy's most enduring institutional failure modes flow from its insistence on placing the individual and individualized control at the center. Strategies for rescuing privacy from irrelevance involve inverting both established ways of talking about privacy rights and established conventions for designing institutions to protect them. In terms of theory, turning privacy inside out entails focusing on the conditions that are needed to produce sufficiently private and privacy-valuing subjects. Institutionally, turning privacy inside out entails focusing on the design, production, and operational practices most likely to instantiate and preserve those conditions."

    ,"abstract":"In their day-today operations, public sector organizations collect and use huge amounts of information that if made available for re-use would contribute to economic growth. Much of this information directly or indirectly can lead to the identification of 'natural persons' and, as such, the personal data protection regulation applies to it. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) issued by the EU in 2016, unless it is regulated by a specific legislation, personal information can be processed only based on the data subject's explicit consent. This raises the question of what strategies public organizations could implement to make the data subjects willing to allow the (possible) re-use of their personal information. By elaborating on evidences from the economics and the psychology of privacy literature, the paper suggests that public sector organizations can implement a coproduction strategy to unlock the value of public sector personal information in a user-centric personal information ecosystem. More specifically , the paper argues that the data subjects can be made more willing to consent to the processing (and possibly to the re-use) of personal information by involving them as coproducers in the processes through which public sector organizations can support economic growth in the digital society.

In the first case we show that the monopolist may choose to either produce or repurchase the old good once the new one becomes available. In the latter case we determine when the monopolist chooses to offer upgrade discounts. "

    ,"abstract":"With the advent of Internet technologies, information privacy has emerged as an important but complicated notion that is difficult to articulate and conceptualize in technological system design. In this study we identify the key baseline factors for designing privacy-enhancing systems from users' perspective. Utilizing Solove's pragmatic approach to investigate global users' conceptualization of information privacy, we identify two indicators that pertain to information privacy: users' need for information control (NIC) and their perceived risks of information misuse (PRIM). We also examined social influences on these indicators, including region, age, and gender. Our results show that users from different regions of the world consider 'the ability to stop unauthorized access' as their foremost priority for information control, while they report 'the invasion of personal private sphere' as the highest risk for information misuse. We also found that social factors greatly impact these two indicators. For instance, users from different regions exhibit different needs for information control and perceive risks differently. Based on users' NIC and PRIM as well as regional and generational differences, we propose several user-centered design directions for system developers and policy makers to advance privacy-enhancing systems globally."

    ,"abstract":"One of the key challenges in the information society is responsible handling of personal data. An often-cited reason why people fail to make rational decisions regarding their own informational privacy is the high uncertainty about future consequences of information disclosures today. This chapter builds an analogy to financial options and draws on principles of option pricing to account for this uncertainty in the valuation of privacy. For this purpose, the development of a data subject's personal attributes over time and the development of the attribute distribution in the population are modeled as two stochastic processes, which fit into the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM). Possible applications of such valuation methods to guide decision support in future privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are sketched."

    ,"abstract":"A concern central to the economics of privacy is that firms may exploit consumer data to engage in greater price discrimination. A common response to these concerns is that consumers should have sovereignty over their own data, and choose whether firms access it. Since the market may draw inferences whenever a consumer withholds information about her preferences, the strategic implications of consumer data sovereignty are unclear. This paper investigates whether such measures improve consumer welfare in both monopolistic and competitive environments. We consider the interaction between a consumer, whose preferences are not known to the market, and a market that makes price offers to that consumer based on verifiable disclosures about her type. We show that a consumer can optimally use verifiable information about her preference to create exclusive partial pools that guarantee gains relative to perfect price discrimination."

    ,"abstract":"We experimentally analyze a lemons market with a labor-market framing. Sellers are referred to as 'workers' and have the possibility to provide 'employers' with costly but credible information about their 'productivity'. Economic theory suggests that in this setup, unraveling takes place and a number of different types are correctly identified in equilibrium. While we do observe a substantial degree of information disclosure, we also find that unraveling is typically not as complete as predicted by economic theory. The behavior of both workers and employers impedes unraveling in that there is too little disclosure. Workers are generally reluctant to disclose their private information, and employers enforce this behavior by bidding less competitively if workers reveal compared to the case where they conceal information."

    ,"abstract":"Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has been hailed by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest minds of this century. His creation has already changed the way people do business, entertain themselves, exchange ideas, and socialize with one another. With new online businesses and communities forming every day, the full impact of Berners-Lee's grand scheme has yet to be fully realized. Now, this low-profile genius tells his own story of the Web's origins—from its radical introduction and the creation of the now ubiquitous WWW and HTTP acronyms to how he sees the future development of this revolutionary medium. Berners-Lee offers insights to help listeners understand the true nature of the Web, enabling them to use it to their fullest advantage. He shares his views on such critical issues as censorship, privacy, and the increasing power of software companies in the online world."

    ,"abstract":"Adverse drug events cause substantial morbidity and mortality and are often discovered after a drug comes to market. We hypothesized that Internet users may provide early clues about adverse drug events via their online information-seeking. We conducted a large-scale study of Web search log data gathered during 2010. We pay particular attention to the specific drug pairing of paroxetine and pravastatin, whose interaction was reported to cause hyperglycemia after the time period of the online logs used in the analysis. We also examine sets of drug pairs known to be associated with hyperglycemia and those not associated with hyperglycemia. We find that anonymized signals on drug interactions can be mined from search logs. Compared to analyses of other sources such as electronic health records (EHR), logs are inexpensive to collect and mine. The results demonstrate that logs of the search activities of populations of computer users can contribute to drug safety surveillance."

We exploit the staggered entry of PHYD insurance across states and insurers in a difference-in-differences framework, and we replicate the main findings using state insurance regulations as instruments for entry timing. We find a meaningful impact of PHYD programs on fatal accidents, but we find no evidence of antitrust concerns."

All of them reveal two important aspects of being linked together in a common thread. Firstly, humans are getting smarter through advanced technology, as they are living in an age of information. In this age data is not merely a piece of information, rather it is equivalent to an ‘economic good' or ‘commodity' and even regarded as an ‘asset.'

We use a field experiment informed by behavioral economics and decision research to investigate individual privacy valuations and find evidence of endowment and order effects. Individuals assigned markedly different values to the privacy of their data depending on (1) whether they were asked to consider how much money they would accept to disclose otherwise private information or how much they would pay to protect otherwise public information and (2) the order in which they considered different offers for their data. The gap between such values is large compared with that observed in comparable studies of consumer goods. The results highlight the sensitivity of privacy valuations to contextual, nonnormative factors."

    ,"link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10841"
    ,"abstract":"Tablet computers are widely used by young children. A report in 2016 shows that children aged 5 to 15 years are spending more time online than watching TV. A 2017 update of the same report shows that parents are becoming more concerned about their children's online risks compared to the previous year. Parents are working hard to protect their children's online safety. An increasing number of parents are setting up content filtering at home or having regular discussions with their children regarding online risks. However, although risks related to Social Media platforms or social video sharing sites (like YouTube) are widely known, risks posed by mobile applications or games (i.e. `apps') are less known. Behind the cute characters, apps used by children can not only have the possibility of exposing them to age-inappropriate content or excessive in-app promotions, but may also make a large amount of their personal information accessible to third-party online marketing and advertising industry. Such practices are not unique to children's apps, but young children are probably less capable of resisting the resulting personalised advertisements and game promotions. In this report, we present findings from our online survey of 220 parents with children aged 6-10, mainly from the U.K. and other western countries, regarding their privacy concerns and expectations of their children's use of mobile apps. Parents play a key role in children's use of digital technology, especially for children under 10 years old. Recent reports have highlighted parents' lack of sufficient support for choosing appropriate digital content for their children. Our report sheds some initial light on parents' key struggles and points to immediate steps and possible areas of future development."

    ,"link":"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.11.0503"
    ,"abstract":"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages."

    ,"link":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2764907"
    ,"abstract":"We shed light on a money-for-privacy trade-off in the market for smartphone applications ('apps'). Developers offer their apps cheaper in return for greater access to personal information, and consumers choose between lower prices and more privacy. We provide evidence for this pattern using data on 300,000 mobile applications which were obtained from the Android Market in 2012 and 2014. We augmented these data with information from Alexa.com and Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings show that both the market's supply and the demand side consider an app's ability to collect private information, measured by their use of privacy-sensitive permissions: (1) cheaper apps use more privacy-sensitive permissions; (2) installation numbers are lower for apps with sensitive permissions; (3) circumstantial factors, such as the reputation of app developers, mitigate the strength of this relationship. Our results emerge consistently across several robustness checks, including the use of panel data analysis, the use of selected matched 'twin'-pairs of apps and the use of various alternative measures of privacy-sensitiveness."

    ,"abstract":"In the knowledge-based economy data has become an important part of building competitive advantage. The private and public sectors are demonstrating enormous interest in acquiring increasingly greater amounts of information. From growing sets of unstructured, seemingly disconnected data, one can extract information that can not only identify a given person, but also determine their demographic, socio-geographical, behavioral or mental characteristics, learn their shopping preferences, track their daily schedules and habits. In this sense, it becomes attractive to any kind of company operating online, including advertisers. On the other side of the stage there are consumers for whom private information is a resource that can be exchanged for various tangible and intangible benefits. Irrespective of the fact that some of the private information is perceived as more sensitively or more worthy than other, customers, as evidenced by numerous studies, choose money over data. The value of information depends on who owns it, who wants it, and who and how much is willing to pay for it. The aim of the paper is to present the concept of the value of private information from the perspective of customers and companies."

    ,"abstract":"We analyze the incentives to divert search for an information intermediary who enables buyers (consumers) to search affiliated sellers (stores). We identify two original motives for diverting search (i.e., inducing consumers to search more than they would like): (i) trading off higher total consumer traffic for higher revenues per consumer visit; and (ii) influencing stores' choices of strategic variables (e.g., pricing). We characterize the conditions under which there would be no role for search diversion as a strategic instrument for the intermediary, thereby showing that it occurs even when the contracting space is significantly enriched. We then discuss several applications related to online and brick‐and‐mortar intermediaries."

Our goal is to inform policy and the design of future Internet architecture and applications. We interviewed 44 people from America, Asia, Europe, and Africa who had sought anonymity and asked them about their experiences. A key finding of our research is the very large variation in interviewees' past experiences and life situations leading them to seek anonymity, and how they tried to achieve it. Our results suggest implications for the design of online communities, challenges for policy, and ways to improve anonymity tools and educate users about the different routes and threats to anonymity on the Internet."

From the boardroom to the customer landscape, executives are vying for visibility into what big data actually means to them and their businesses. Today's executives are trying to find a way to move the checklist of items that seemingly have been on a to-do list for the past 12-18 months to a real action, facilitating a strategy that actually outlines what they can -- and must do -- with their data to grow the business and preserve their brand."

    ,"abstract":"Social logins, such as 'Log in with Facebook,' improve a website's user experience and therefore enjoy great popularity among content providers (CPs) and users alike. Moreover, they also enable the social network and the CPs to share data, which individually improves their ability to place targeted advertising. On the basis of a game-theoretic model that offers a microfoundation for CPs' competition for advertisements, on the one hand, and CPs' competition for users, on the other hand, we demonstrate the strategic effects of social logins in the online advertising ecosystem. We fully characterize the market conditions under which social logins are offered and adopted, and when the adoption is actually profitable for the CPs. In particular, we show across several model extensions that the voluntary adoption of the social login may yield a prisoner's dilemma outcome for the CPs."

    ,"link":"https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/130573"
    ,"abstract":"Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die wesentlichen ökonomischen Aspekte der so genannten Sharing-Economy. Bei den dort tätigen Unternehmen handelt es sich zumeist um Plattformen, die direkte Transaktionen zwischen Akteuren mit dem Zweck einer temporären Nutzung dauerhafter Konsumgüter und damit verbundener Dienstleistungen vermitteln. Diese Sharing-Plattformen konnten vor allem aufgrund technologischer Entwicklungen entstehen, die die Transaktionskosten, wie z.B. aufgrund asymmetrischer Information über den Transaktionspartner, extrem reduziert haben. Dieses Informationsproblem adressieren Sharing-Plattformen ohne staatliche Regulierung mittels Rating- und Reputationssystemen. Die Sharing-Economy ist jedoch keineswegs eine 'Ökonomie des Teilens', sondern auch in diesem Wirtschaftsbereich werden ökonomische Güter ge- und verkauft. Im vorliegenden Beitrag untersuchen die Autoren die kurz- und langfristigen allokativen Effekte der Sharing-Economy und diskutieren mögliche Externalitäten sowie ihre Auswirkungen auf soziale Beziehungen. Anschließend gehen die Autoren der Frage nach, wie eine ökonomisch sinnvolle Regulierung von Sharing-Plattformen ausgestaltet sein sollte und welche Wettbewerbsprobleme sie verursachen könnten. Abschließend wird auf mögliche Entwicklungen dieses neuen Wirtschaftsbereiches eingegangen."
